     Prospect Of The Ruins Of Rome In The Fifteenth Century.—
     Four Causes Of Decay And Destruction.—Example Of The
     Coliseum.—Renovation Of The City.—Conclusion Of The Whole
     Work.
</pre>
<p>
      In the last days of Pope Eugenius the Fourth, <a href="#Flink71note-101" id="Flink71noteref-101" name="Flink71noteref-101">101</a> two of his
      servants, the learned Poggius <a href="#Flink71note-1" id="Flink71noteref-1" name="Flink71noteref-1">1</a> and a friend, ascended
      the Capitoline hill; reposed themselves among the ruins of columns and
      temples; and viewed from that commanding spot the wide and various
      prospect of desolation. <a href="#Flink71note-2" id="Flink71noteref-2" name="Flink71noteref-2">2</a> The place and the object gave ample scope for
      moralizing on the vicissitudes of fortune, which spares neither man nor
      the proudest of his works, which buries empires and cities in a common
      grave; and it was agreed, that in proportion to her former greatness, the
      fall of Rome was the more awful and deplorable. "Her primeval state, such
      as she might appear in a remote age, when Evander entertained the stranger
      of Troy, <a href="#Flink71note-3" id="Flink71noteref-3" name="Flink71noteref-3">3</a> has been delineated by the fancy of Virgil.
      This Tarpeian rock was then a savage and solitary thicket: in the time of
      the poet, it was crowned with the golden roofs of a temple; the temple is
      overthrown, the gold has been pillaged, the wheel of fortune has
      accomplished her revolution, and the sacred ground is again disfigured
      with thorns and brambles. The hill of the Capitol, on which we sit, was
      formerly the head of the Roman empire, the citadel of the earth, the
      terror of kings; illustrated by the footsteps of so many triumphs,
      enriched with the spoils and tributes of so many nations. This spectacle
      of the world, how is it fallen! how changed! how defaced! The path of
      victory is obliterated by vines, and the benches of the senators are
      concealed by a dunghill. Cast your eyes on the Palatine hill, and seek
      among the shapeless and enormous fragments the marble theatre, the
      obelisks, the colossal statues, the porticos of Nero's palace: survey the
      other hills of the city, the vacant space is interrupted only by ruins and
      gardens. The forum of the Roman people, where they assembled to enact
      their laws and elect their magistrates, is now enclosed for the
      cultivation of pot-herbs, or thrown open for the reception of swine and
      buffaloes. The public and private edifices, that were founded for
      eternity, lie prostrate, naked, and broken, like the limbs of a mighty
      giant; and the ruin is the more visible, from the stupendous relics that
      have survived the injuries of time and fortune." <a href="#Flink71note-4" id="Flink71noteref-4" name="Flink71noteref-4">4</a>

<p>
      These relics are minutely described by Poggius, one of the first who
      raised his eyes from the monuments of legendary, to those of classic,
      superstition. <a href="#Flink71note-5" id="Flink71noteref-5" name="Flink71noteref-5">5</a> <i>1.</i>Besides a bridge, an arch, a
      sepulchre, and the pyramid of Cestius, he could discern, of the age of the
      republic, a double row of vaults, in the salt-office of the Capitol, which
      were inscribed with the name and munificence of Catulus. <i>2.</i> Eleven
      temples were visible in some degree, from the perfect form of the
      Pantheon, to the three arches and a marble column of the temple of Peace,
      which Vespasian erected after the civil wars and the Jewish triumph. <i>3.</i>
      Of the number, which he rashly defines, of seven <i>thermæ</i>, or public
      baths, none were sufficiently entire to represent the use and distribution
      of the several parts: but those of Diocletian and Antoninus Caracalla
      still retained the titles of the founders, and astonished the curious
      spectator, who, in observing their solidity and extent, the variety of
      marbles, the size and multitude of the columns, compared the labor and
      expense with the use and importance. Of the baths of Constantine, of
      Alexander, of Domitian, or rather of Titus, some vestige might yet be
      found. <i>4.</i> The triumphal arches of Titus, Severus, and Constantine,
      were entire, both the structure and the inscriptions; a falling fragment
      was honored with the name of Trajan; and two arches, then extant, in the
      Flaminian way, have been ascribed to the baser memory of Faustina and
      Gallienus. <a href="#Flink71note-501" id="Flink71noteref-501" name="Flink71noteref-501">501</a> <i>5.</i> After the wonder of the Coliseum,
      Poggius might have overlooked small amphitheatre of brick, most probably
      for the use of the prætorian camp: the theatres of Marcellus and Pompey
      were occupied in a great measure by public and private buildings; and in
      the Circus, Agonalis and Maximus, little more than the situation and the
      form could be investigated. <i>6.</i> The columns of Trajan and Antonine
      were still erect; but the Egyptian obelisks were broken or buried. A
      people of gods and heroes, the workmanship of art, was reduced to one
      equestrian figure of gilt brass, and to five marble statues, of which the
      most conspicuous were the two horses of Phidias and Praxiteles. <i>7.</i>
      The two mausoleums or sepulchres of Augustus and Hadrian could not totally
      be lost: but the former was only visible as a mound of earth; and the
      latter, the castle of St. Angelo, had acquired the name and appearance of
      a modern fortress. With the addition of some separate and nameless
      columns, such were the remains of the ancient city; for the marks of a
      more recent structure might be detected in the walls, which formed a
      circumference of ten miles, included three hundred and seventy-nine
      turrets, and opened into the country by thirteen gates.

    </p>
<p>
      This melancholy picture was drawn above nine hundred years after the fall
      of the Western empire, and even of the Gothic kingdom of Italy. A long
      period of distress and anarchy, in which empire, and arts, and riches had
      migrated from the banks of the Tyber, was incapable of restoring or
      adorning the city; and, as all that is human must retrograde if it do not
      advance, every successive age must have hastened the ruin of the works of
      antiquity. To measure the progress of decay, and to ascertain, at each
      æra, the state of each edifice, would be an endless and a useless labor;
      and I shall content myself with two observations, which will introduce a
      short inquiry into the general causes and effects. <i>1.</i> Two hundred
      years before the eloquent complaint of Poggius, an anonymous writer
      composed a description of Rome. <a href="#Flink71note-6" id="Flink71noteref-6" name="Flink71noteref-6">6</a> His ignorance may repeat
      the same objects under strange and fabulous names. Yet this barbarous
      topographer had eyes and ears; he could observe the visible remains; he
      could listen to the tradition of the people; and he distinctly enumerates
      seven theatres, eleven baths, twelve arches, and eighteen palaces, of
      which many had disappeared before the time of Poggius. It is apparent,
      that many stately monuments of antiquity survived till a late period, <a href="#Flink71note-7" id="Flink71noteref-7" name="Flink71noteref-7">7</a> and
      that the principles of destruction acted with vigorous and increasing
      energy in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. <i>2.</i> The same
      reflection must be applied to the three last ages; and we should vainly
      seek the Septizonium of Severus; <a href="#Flink71note-8" id="Flink71noteref-8" name="Flink71noteref-8">8</a> which is celebrated by
      Petrarch and the antiquarians of the sixteenth century. While the Roman
      edifices were still entire, the first blows, however weighty and
      impetuous, were resisted by the solidity of the mass and the harmony of
      the parts; but the slightest touch would precipitate the fragments of
      arches and columns, that already nodded to their fall.

    </p>
<p>
      After a diligent inquiry, I can discern four principal causes of the ruin
      of Rome, which continued to operate in a period of more than a thousand
      years. I. The injuries of time and nature. II. The hostile attacks of the
      Barbarians and Christians. III. The use and abuse of the materials. And,
      IV. The domestic quarrels of the Romans.
    </p>
<p>
      I. The art of man is able to construct monuments far more permanent than
      the narrow span of his own existence; yet these monuments, like himself,
      are perishable and frail; and in the boundless annals of time, his life
      and his labors must equally be measured as a fleeting moment. Of a simple
      and solid edifice, it is not easy, however, to circumscribe the duration.
      As the wonders of ancient days, the pyramids <a href="#Flink71note-9" id="Flink71noteref-9" name="Flink71noteref-9">9</a> attracted the curiosity
      of the ancients: a hundred generations, the leaves of autumn, have dropped
      <a href="#Flink71note-10" id="Flink71noteref-10" name="Flink71noteref-10">10</a>
      into the grave; and after the fall of the Pharaohs and Ptolemies, the
      Cæsars and caliphs, the same pyramids stand erect and unshaken above the
      floods of the Nile. A complex figure of various and minute parts to more
      accessible to injury and decay; and the silent lapse of time is often
      accelerated by hurricanes and earthquakes, by fires and inundations. The
      air and earth have doubtless been shaken; and the lofty turrets of Rome
      have tottered from their foundations; but the seven hills do not appear to
      be placed on the great cavities of the globe; nor has the city, in any
      age, been exposed to the convulsions of nature, which, in the climate of
      Antioch, Lisbon, or Lima, have crumbled in a few moments the works of ages
      into dust. Fire is the most powerful agent of life and death: the rapid
      mischief may be kindled and propagated by the industry or negligence of
      mankind; and every period of the Roman annals is marked by the repetition
      of similar calamities. A memorable conflagration, the guilt or misfortune
      of Nero's reign, continued, though with unequal fury, either six or nine
      days. <a href="#Flink71note-11" id="Flink71noteref-11" name="Flink71noteref-11">11</a> Innumerable buildings, crowded in close and
      crooked streets, supplied perpetual fuel for the flames; and when they
      ceased, four only of the fourteen regions were left entire; three were
      totally destroyed, and seven were deformed by the relics of smoking and
      lacerated edifices. <a href="#Flink71note-12" id="Flink71noteref-12" name="Flink71noteref-12">12</a> In the full meridian of empire, the
      metropolis arose with fresh beauty from her ashes; yet the memory of the
      old deplored their irreparable losses, the arts of Greece, the trophies of
      victory, the monuments of primitive or fabulous antiquity. In the days of
      distress and anarchy, every wound is mortal, every fall irretrievable; nor
      can the damage be restored either by the public care of government, or the
      activity of private interest. Yet two causes may be alleged, which render
      the calamity of fire more destructive to a flourishing than a decayed
      city. <i>1.</i> The more combustible materials of brick, timber, and
      metals, are first melted or consumed; but the flames may play without
      injury or effect on the naked walls, and massy arches, that have been
      despoiled of their ornaments. <i>2.</i> It is among the common and
      plebeian habitations, that a mischievous spark is most easily blown to a
      conflagration; but as soon as they are devoured, the greater edifices,
      which have resisted or escaped, are left as so many islands in a state of
      solitude and safety. From her situation, Rome is exposed to the danger of
      frequent inundations. Without excepting the Tyber, the rivers that descend
      from either side of the Apennine have a short and irregular course; a
      shallow stream in the summer heats; an impetuous torrent, when it is
      swelled in the spring or winter, by the fall of rain, and the melting of
      the snows. When the current is repelled from the sea by adverse winds,
      when the ordinary bed is inadequate to the weight of waters, they rise
      above the banks, and overspread, without limits or control, the plains and
      cities of the adjacent country. Soon after the triumph of the first Punic
      war, the Tyber was increased by unusual rains; and the inundation,
      surpassing all former measure of time and place, destroyed all the
      buildings that were situated below the hills of Rome. According to the
      variety of ground, the same mischief was produced by different means; and
      the edifices were either swept away by the sudden impulse, or dissolved
      and undermined by the long continuance, of the flood. <a href="#Flink71note-13" id="Flink71noteref-13" name="Flink71noteref-13">13</a>
      Under the reign of Augustus, the same calamity was renewed: the lawless
      river overturned the palaces and temples on its banks; <a href="#Flink71note-14" id="Flink71noteref-14" name="Flink71noteref-14">14</a>
      and, after the labors of the emperor in cleansing and widening the bed
      that was encumbered with ruins, <a href="#Flink71note-15" id="Flink71noteref-15" name="Flink71noteref-15">15</a> the vigilance of his
      successors was exercised by similar dangers and designs. The project of
      diverting into new channels the Tyber itself, or some of the dependent
      streams, was long opposed by superstition and local interests; <a href="#Flink71note-16" id="Flink71noteref-16" name="Flink71noteref-16">16</a>
      nor did the use compensate the toil and cost of the tardy and imperfect
      execution. The servitude of rivers is the noblest and most important
      victory which man has obtained over the licentiousness of nature; <a href="#Flink71note-17" id="Flink71noteref-17" name="Flink71noteref-17">17</a>
      and if such were the ravages of the Tyber under a firm and active
      government, what could oppose, or who can enumerate, the injuries of the
      city, after the fall of the Western empire? A remedy was at length
      produced by the evil itself: the accumulation of rubbish and the earth,
      that has been washed down from the hills, is supposed to have elevated the
      plain of Rome, fourteen or fifteen feet, perhaps, above the ancient level;
      <a href="#Flink71note-18" id="Flink71noteref-18" name="Flink71noteref-18">18</a>
      and the modern city is less accessible to the attacks of the river. <a href="#Flink71note-19" id="Flink71noteref-19" name="Flink71noteref-19">19</a>

      II. The crowd of writers of every nation, who impute the destruction of
      the Roman monuments to the Goths and the Christians, have neglected to
      inquire how far they were animated by a hostile principle, and how far
      they possessed the means and the leisure to satiate their enmity. In the
      preceding volumes of this History, I have described the triumph of
      barbarism and religion; and I can only resume, in a few words, their real
      or imaginary connection with the ruin of ancient Rome. Our fancy may
      create, or adopt, a pleasing romance, that the Goths and Vandals sallied
      from Scandinavia, ardent to avenge the flight of Odin; <a href="#Flink71note-20" id="Flink71noteref-20" name="Flink71noteref-20">20</a>
      to break the chains, and to chastise the oppressors, of mankind; that they
      wished to burn the records of classic literature, and to found their
      national architecture on the broken members of the Tuscan and Corinthian
      orders. But in simple truth, the northern conquerors were neither
      sufficiently savage, nor sufficiently refined, to entertain such aspiring
      ideas of destruction and revenge. The shepherds of Scythia and Germany had
      been educated in the armies of the empire, whose discipline they acquired,
      and whose weakness they invaded: with the familiar use of the Latin
      tongue, they had learned to reverence the name and titles of Rome; and,
      though incapable of emulating, they were more inclined to admire, than to
      abolish, the arts and studies of a brighter period. In the transient
      possession of a rich and unresisting capital, the soldiers of Alaric and
      Genseric were stimulated by the passions of a victorious army; amidst the
      wanton indulgence of lust or cruelty, portable wealth was the object of
      their search; nor could they derive either pride or pleasure from the
      unprofitable reflection, that they had battered to the ground the works of
      the consuls and Cæsars. Their moments were indeed precious; the Goths
      evacuated Rome on the sixth, <a href="#Flink71note-21" id="Flink71noteref-21" name="Flink71noteref-21">21</a> the Vandals on the
      fifteenth, day: <a href="#Flink71note-22" id="Flink71noteref-22" name="Flink71noteref-22">22</a> and, though it be far more difficult to build
      than to destroy, their hasty assault would have made a slight impression
      on the solid piles of antiquity. We may remember, that both Alaric and
      Genseric affected to spare the buildings of the city; that they subsisted
      in strength and beauty under the auspicious government of Theodoric; <a href="#Flink71note-23" id="Flink71noteref-23" name="Flink71noteref-23">23</a>
      and that the momentary resentment of Totila <a href="#Flink71note-24" id="Flink71noteref-24" name="Flink71noteref-24">24</a> was disarmed by his
      own temper and the advice of his friends and enemies. From these innocent
      Barbarians, the reproach may be transferred to the Catholics of Rome. The
      statues, altars, and houses, of the dæmons, were an abomination in their
      eyes; and in the absolute command of the city, they might labor with zeal
      and perseverance to erase the idolatry of their ancestors. The demolition
      of the temples in the East <a href="#Flink71note-25" id="Flink71noteref-25" name="Flink71noteref-25">25</a> affords to <i>them</i> an example of conduct,
      and to <i>us</i> an argument of belief; and it is probable that a portion
      of guilt or merit may be imputed with justice to the Roman proselytes. Yet
      their abhorrence was confined to the monuments of heathen superstition;
      and the civil structures that were dedicated to the business or pleasure
      of society might be preserved without injury or scandal. The change of
      religion was accomplished, not by a popular tumult, but by the decrees of
      the emperors, of the senate, and of time. Of the Christian hierarchy, the
      bishops of Rome were commonly the most prudent and least fanatic; nor can
      any positive charge be opposed to the meritorious act of saving or
      converting the majestic structure of the Pantheon. <a href="#Flink71note-26" id="Flink71noteref-26" name="Flink71noteref-26">26</a> <a href="#Flink71note-261" id="Flink71noteref-261" name="Flink71noteref-261">261</a>

      III. The value of any object that supplies the wants or pleasures of
      mankind is compounded of its substance and its form, of the materials and
      the manufacture. Its price must depend on the number of persons by whom it
      may be acquired and used; on the extent of the market; and consequently on
      the ease or difficulty of remote exportation, according to the nature of
      the commodity, its local situation, and the temporary circumstances of the
      world. The Barbarian conquerors of Rome usurped in a moment the toil and
      treasure of successive ages; but, except the luxuries of immediate
      consumption, they must view without desire all that could not be removed
      from the city in the Gothic wagons or the fleet of the Vandals. <a href="#Flink71note-27" id="Flink71noteref-27" name="Flink71noteref-27">27</a>
      Gold and silver were the first objects of their avarice; as in every
      country, and in the smallest compass, they represent the most ample
      command of the industry and possessions of mankind. A vase or a statue of
      those precious metals might tempt the vanity of some Barbarian chief; but
      the grosser multitude, regardless of the form, was tenacious only of the
      substance; and the melted ingots might be readily divided and stamped into
      the current coin of the empire. The less active or less fortunate robbers
      were reduced to the baser plunder of brass, lead, iron, and copper:
      whatever had escaped the Goths and Vandals was pillaged by the Greek
      tyrants; and the emperor Constans, in his rapacious visit, stripped the
      bronze tiles from the roof of the Pantheon. <a href="#Flink71note-28" id="Flink71noteref-28" name="Flink71noteref-28">28</a> The edifices of Rome
      might be considered as a vast and various mine; the first labor of
      extracting the materials was already performed; the metals were purified
      and cast; the marbles were hewn and polished; and after foreign and
      domestic rapine had been satiated, the remains of the city, could a
      purchaser have been found, were still venal. The monuments of antiquity
      had been left naked of their precious ornaments; but the Romans would
      demolish with their own hands the arches and walls, if the hope of profit
      could surpass the cost of the labor and exportation. If Charlemagne had
      fixed in Italy the seat of the Western empire, his genius would have
      aspired to restore, rather than to violate, the works of the Cæsars; but
      policy confined the French monarch to the forests of Germany; his taste
      could be gratified only by destruction; and the new palace of Aix la
      Chapelle was decorated with the marbles of Ravenna <a href="#Flink71note-29" id="Flink71noteref-29" name="Flink71noteref-29">29</a> and Rome. <a href="#Flink71note-30" id="Flink71noteref-30" name="Flink71noteref-30">30</a>
      Five hundred years after Charlemagne, a king of Sicily, Robert, the wisest
      and most liberal sovereign of the age, was supplied with the same
      materials by the easy navigation of the Tyber and the sea; and Petrarch
      sighs an indignant complaint, that the ancient capital of the world should
      adorn from her own bowels the slothful luxury of Naples. <a href="#Flink71note-31" id="Flink71noteref-31" name="Flink71noteref-31">31</a>
      But these examples of plunder or purchase were rare in the darker ages;
      and the Romans, alone and unenvied, might have applied to their private or
      public use the remaining structures of antiquity, if in their present form
      and situation they had not been useless in a great measure to the city and
      its inhabitants. The walls still described the old circumference, but the
      city had descended from the seven hills into the Campus Martius; and some
      of the noblest monuments which had braved the injuries of time were left
      in a desert, far remote from the habitations of mankind. The palaces of
      the senators were no longer adapted to the manners or fortunes of their
      indigent successors: the use of baths <a href="#Flink71note-32" id="Flink71noteref-32" name="Flink71noteref-32">32</a> and porticos was
      forgotten: in the sixth century, the games of the theatre, amphitheatre,
      and circus, had been interrupted: some temples were devoted to the
      prevailing worship; but the Christian churches preferred the holy figure
      of the cross; and fashion, or reason, had distributed after a peculiar
      model the cells and offices of the cloister. Under the ecclesiastical
      reign, the number of these pious foundations was enormously multiplied;
      and the city was crowded with forty monasteries of men, twenty of women,
      and sixty chapters and colleges of canons and priests, <a href="#Flink71note-33" id="Flink71noteref-33" name="Flink71noteref-33">33</a>
      who aggravated, instead of relieving, the depopulation of the tenth
      century. But if the forms of ancient architecture were disregarded by a
      people insensible of their use and beauty, the plentiful materials were
      applied to every call of necessity or superstition; till the fairest
      columns of the Ionic and Corinthian orders, the richest marbles of Paros
      and Numidia, were degraded, perhaps to the support of a convent or a
      stable. The daily havoc which is perpetrated by the Turks in the cities of
      Greece and Asia may afford a melancholy example; and in the gradual
      destruction of the monuments of Rome, Sixtus the Fifth may alone be
      excused for employing the stones of the Septizonium in the glorious
      edifice of St. Peter's. <a href="#Flink71note-34" id="Flink71noteref-34" name="Flink71noteref-34">34</a> A fragment, a ruin, howsoever mangled or
      profaned, may be viewed with pleasure and regret; but the greater part of
      the marble was deprived of substance, as well as of place and proportion;
      it was burnt to lime for the purpose of cement. <a href="#Flink71note-341" id="Flink71noteref-341" name="Flink71noteref-341">341</a> Since the arrival
      of Poggius, the temple of Concord, <a href="#Flink71note-35" id="Flink71noteref-35" name="Flink71noteref-35">35</a> and many capital
      structures, had vanished from his eyes; and an epigram of the same age
      expresses a just and pious fear, that the continuance of this practice
      would finally annihilate all the monuments of antiquity. <a href="#Flink71note-36" id="Flink71noteref-36" name="Flink71noteref-36">36</a>
      The smallness of their numbers was the sole check on the demands and
      depredations of the Romans. The imagination of Petrarch might create the
      presence of a mighty people; <a href="#Flink71note-37" id="Flink71noteref-37" name="Flink71noteref-37">37</a> and I hesitate to
      believe, that, even in the fourteenth century, they could be reduced to a
      contemptible list of thirty-three thousand inhabitants. From that period
      to the reign of Leo the Tenth, if they multiplied to the amount of
      eighty-five thousand, <a href="#Flink71note-38" id="Flink71noteref-38" name="Flink71noteref-38">38</a> the increase of citizens was in some degree

<p>
      IV. I have reserved for the last, the most potent and forcible cause of
      destruction, the domestic hostilities of the Romans themselves. Under the
      dominion of the Greek and French emperors, the peace of the city was
      disturbed by accidental, though frequent, seditions: it is from the
      decline of the latter, from the beginning of the tenth century, that we
      may date the licentiousness of private war, which violated with impunity
      the laws of the Code and the Gospel, without respecting the majesty of the
      absent sovereign, or the presence and person of the vicar of Christ. In a
      dark period of five hundred years, Rome was perpetually afflicted by the
      sanguinary quarrels of the nobles and the people, the Guelphs and
      Ghibelines, the Colonna and Ursini; and if much has escaped the knowledge,
      and much is unworthy of the notice, of history, I have exposed in the two
      preceding chapters the causes and effects of the public disorders. At such
      a time, when every quarrel was decided by the sword, and none could trust
      their lives or properties to the impotence of law, the powerful citizens
      were armed for safety, or offence, against the domestic enemies whom they
      feared or hated. Except Venice alone, the same dangers and designs were
      common to all the free republics of Italy; and the nobles usurped the
      prerogative of fortifying their houses, and erecting strong towers, <a href="#Flink71note-39" id="Flink71noteref-39" name="Flink71noteref-39">39</a>
      that were capable of resisting a sudden attack. The cities were filled
      with these hostile edifices; and the example of Lucca, which contained
      three hundred towers; her law, which confined their height to the measure
      of fourscore feet, may be extended with suitable latitude to the more
      opulent and populous states. The first step of the senator Brancaleone in
      the establishment of peace and justice, was to demolish (as we have
      already seen) one hundred and forty of the towers of Rome; and, in the
      last days of anarchy and discord, as late as the reign of Martin the
      Fifth, forty-four still stood in one of the thirteen or fourteen regions
      of the city. To this mischievous purpose the remains of antiquity were
      most readily adapted: the temples and arches afforded a broad and solid
      basis for the new structures of brick and stone; and we can name the
      modern turrets that were raised on the triumphal monuments of Julius
      Cæsar, Titus, and the Antonines. <a href="#Flink71note-40" id="Flink71noteref-40" name="Flink71noteref-40">40</a> With some slight
      alterations, a theatre, an amphitheatre, a mausoleum, was transformed into
      a strong and spacious citadel. I need not repeat, that the mole of Adrian
      has assumed the title and form of the castle of St. Angelo; <a href="#Flink71note-41" id="Flink71noteref-41" name="Flink71noteref-41">41</a>
      the Septizonium of Severus was capable of standing against a royal army;
      <a href="#Flink71note-42" id="Flink71noteref-42" name="Flink71noteref-42">42</a>
      the sepulchre of Metella has sunk under its outworks; <a href="#Flink71note-43" id="Flink71noteref-43" name="Flink71noteref-43">43</a>
<a href="#Flink71note-431" id="Flink71noteref-431" name="Flink71noteref-431">431</a>
      the theatres of Pompey and Marcellus were occupied by the Savelli and
      Ursini families; <a href="#Flink71note-44" id="Flink71noteref-44" name="Flink71noteref-44">44</a> and the rough fortress has been gradually
      softened to the splendor and elegance of an Italian palace. Even the
      churches were encompassed with arms and bulwarks, and the military engines
      on the roof of St. Peter's were the terror of the Vatican and the scandal
      of the Christian world. Whatever is fortified will be attacked; and
      whatever is attacked may be destroyed. Could the Romans have wrested from
      the popes; the castle of St. Angelo, they had resolved by a public decree
      to annihilate that monument of servitude. Every building of defence was
      exposed to a siege; and in every siege the arts and engines of destruction
      were laboriously employed. After the death of Nicholas the Fourth, Rome,
      without a sovereign or a senate, was abandoned six months to the fury of
      civil war. "The houses," says a cardinal and poet of the times, <a href="#Flink71note-45" id="Flink71noteref-45" name="Flink71noteref-45">45</a>
      "were crushed by the weight and velocity of enormous stones; <a href="#Flink71note-46" id="Flink71noteref-46" name="Flink71noteref-46">46</a>
      the walls were perforated by the strokes of the battering-ram; the towers
      were involved in fire and smoke; and the assailants were stimulated by
      rapine and revenge." The work was consummated by the tyranny of the laws;
      and the factions of Italy alternately exercised a blind and thoughtless
      vengeance on their adversaries, whose houses and castles they razed to the
      ground. <a href="#Flink71note-47" id="Flink71noteref-47" name="Flink71noteref-47">47</a> In comparing the <i>days</i> of foreign, with
      the <i>ages</i> of domestic, hostility, we must pronounce, that the latter
      have been far more ruinous to the city; and our opinion is confirmed by
      the evidence of Petrarch. "Behold," says the laureate, "the relics of
      Rome, the image of her pristine greatness! neither time nor the Barbarian
      can boast the merit of this stupendous destruction: it was perpetrated by
      her own citizens, by the most illustrious of her sons; and your ancestors
      (he writes to a noble Annabaldi) have done with the battering-ram what the
      Punic hero could not accomplish with the sword." <a href="#Flink71note-48" id="Flink71noteref-48" name="Flink71noteref-48">48</a> The influence of the
      two last principles of decay must in some degree be multiplied by each
      other; since the houses and towers, which were subverted by civil war,
      required by a new and perpetual supply from the monuments of antiquity. <a href="#Flink71note-481" id="Flink71noteref-481" name="Flink71noteref-481">481</a>

      These general observations may be separately applied to the amphitheatre
      of Titus, which has obtained the name of the Coliseum, <a href="#Flink71note-49" id="Flink71noteref-49" name="Flink71noteref-49">49</a>
      either from its magnitude, or from Nero's colossal statue; an edifice, had
      it been left to time and nature, which might perhaps have claimed an
      eternal duration. The curious antiquaries, who have computed the numbers
      and seats, are disposed to believe, that above the upper row of stone
      steps the amphitheatre was encircled and elevated with several stages of
      wooden galleries, which were repeatedly consumed by fire, and restored by
      the emperors. Whatever was precious, or portable, or profane, the statues
      of gods and heroes, and the costly ornaments of sculpture which were cast
      in brass, or overspread with leaves of silver and gold, became the first
      prey of conquest or fanaticism, of the avarice of the Barbarians or the
      Christians. In the massy stones of the Coliseum, many holes are discerned;
      and the two most probable conjectures represent the various accidents of
      its decay. These stones were connected by solid links of brass or iron,
      nor had the eye of rapine overlooked the value of the baser metals; <a href="#Flink71note-50" id="Flink71noteref-50" name="Flink71noteref-50">50</a>
      the vacant space was converted into a fair or market; the artisans of the
      Coliseum are mentioned in an ancient survey; and the chasms were
      perforated or enlarged to receive the poles that supported the shops or
      tents of the mechanic trades. <a href="#Flink71note-51" id="Flink71noteref-51" name="Flink71noteref-51">51</a> Reduced to its naked
      majesty, the Flavian amphitheatre was contemplated with awe and admiration
      by the pilgrims of the North; and their rude enthusiasm broke forth in a
      sublime proverbial expression, which is recorded in the eighth century, in
      the fragments of the venerable Bede: "As long as the Coliseum stands, Rome
      shall stand; when the Coliseum falls, Rome will fall; when Rome falls, the

      occupied the Vatican and the Capitol, the other was intrenched in the

      or custom of the city. The senator presided with dignity and pomp to
      adjudge and distribute the prizes, the gold ring, or the <i>pallium</i>,
      <a href="#Flink71note-56" id="Flink71noteref-56" name="Flink71noteref-56">56</a>
      as it was styled, of cloth or silk. A tribute on the Jews supplied the
      annual expense; <a href="#Flink71note-57" id="Flink71noteref-57" name="Flink71noteref-57">57</a> and the races, on foot, on horseback, or in
      chariots, were ennobled by a tilt and tournament of seventy-two of the
      Roman youth. In the year one thousand three hundred and thirty-two, a
      bull-feast, after the fashion of the Moors and Spaniards, was celebrated
      in the Coliseum itself; and the living manners are painted in a diary of
      the times. <a href="#Flink71note-58" id="Flink71noteref-58" name="Flink71noteref-58">58</a> A convenient order of benches was restored;
      and a general proclamation, as far as Rimini and Ravenna, invited the
      nobles to exercise their skill and courage in this perilous adventure. The
      Roman ladies were marshalled in three squadrons, and seated in three
      balconies, which, on this day, the third of September, were lined with
      scarlet cloth. The fair Jacova di Rovere led the matrons from beyond the
      Tyber, a pure and native race, who still represent the features and
      character of antiquity. The remainder of the city was divided as usual
      between the Colonna and Ursini: the two factions were proud of the number
      and beauty of their female bands: the charms of Savella Ursini are
      mentioned with praise; and the Colonna regretted the absence of the
      youngest of their house, who had sprained her ankle in the garden of
      Nero's tower. The lots of the champions were drawn by an old and
      respectable citizen; and they descended into the arena, or pit, to
      encounter the wild bulls, on foot as it should seem, with a single spear.
      Amidst the crowd, our annalist has selected the names, colors, and
      devices, of twenty of the most conspicuous knights. Several of the names
      are the most illustrious of Rome and the ecclesiastical state: Malatesta,
      Polenta, della Valle, Cafarello, Savelli, Capoccio, Conti, Annibaldi,
      Altieri, Corsi: the colors were adapted to their taste and situation; the
      devices are expressive of hope or despair, and breathe the spirit of
      gallantry and arms. "I am alone, like the youngest of the Horatii," the
      confidence of an intrepid stranger: "I live disconsolate," a weeping
      widower: "I burn under the ashes," a discreet lover: "I adore Lavinia, or
      Lucretia," the ambiguous declaration of a modern passion: "My faith is as
      pure," the motto of a white livery: "Who is stronger than myself?" of a
      lion's hide: "If am drowned in blood, what a pleasant death!" the wish of
      ferocious courage. The pride or prudence of the Ursini restrained them
      from the field, which was occupied by three of their hereditary rivals,
      whose inscriptions denoted the lofty greatness of the Colonna name:
      "Though sad, I am strong:" "Strong as I am great:" "If I fall," addressing
      himself to the spectators, "you fall with me;"—intimating (says the
      contemporary writer) that while the other families were the subjects of
      the Vatican, they alone were the supporters of the Capitol. The combats of
      the amphitheatre were dangerous and bloody. Every champion successively
      encountered a wild bull; and the victory may be ascribed to the
      quadrupeds, since no more than eleven were left on the field, with the
      loss of nine wounded and eighteen killed on the side of their adversaries.
      Some of the noblest families might mourn, but the pomp of the funerals, in
      the churches of St. John Lateran and St. Maria Maggiore, afforded a second
      holiday to the people. Doubtless it was not in such conflicts that the
      blood of the Romans should have been shed; yet, in blaming their rashness,
      we are compelled to applaud their gallantry; and the noble volunteers, who
      display their magnificence, and risk their lives, under the balconies of
      the fair, excite a more generous sympathy than the thousands of captives
      and malefactors who were reluctantly dragged to the scene of slaughter. <a href="#Flink71note-59" id="Flink71noteref-59" name="Flink71noteref-59">59</a>

      This use of the amphitheatre was a rare, perhaps a singular, festival: the
      demand for the materials was a daily and continual want which the citizens
      could gratify without restraint or remorse. In the fourteenth century, a
      scandalous act of concord secured to both factions the privilege of
      extracting stones from the free and common quarry of the Coliseum; <a href="#Flink71note-60" id="Flink71noteref-60" name="Flink71noteref-60">60</a>
      and Poggius laments, that the greater part of these stones had been burnt
      to lime by the folly of the Romans. <a href="#Flink71note-61" id="Flink71noteref-61" name="Flink71noteref-61">61</a> To check this abuse,
      and to prevent the nocturnal crimes that might be perpetrated in the vast
      and gloomy recess, Eugenius the Fourth surrounded it with a wall; and, by
      a charter long extant, granted both the ground and edifice to the monks of
      an adjacent convent. <a href="#Flink71note-62" id="Flink71noteref-62" name="Flink71noteref-62">62</a> After his death, the wall was overthrown in a
      tumult of the people; and had they themselves respected the noblest
      monument of their fathers, they might have justified the resolve that it
      should never be degraded to private property. The inside was damaged: but
      in the middle of the sixteenth century, an æra of taste and learning, the
      exterior circumference of one thousand six hundred and twelve feet was
      still entire and inviolate; a triple elevation of fourscore arches, which
      rose to the height of one hundred and eight feet. Of the present ruin, the
      nephews of Paul the Third are the guilty agents; and every traveller who

      When Petrarch first gratified his eyes with a view of those monuments,
      whose scattered fragments so far surpass the most eloquent descriptions,
      he was astonished at the supine indifference <a href="#Flink71note-65" id="Flink71noteref-65" name="Flink71noteref-65">65</a> of the Romans
      themselves; <a href="#Flink71note-66" id="Flink71noteref-66" name="Flink71noteref-66">66</a> he was humbled rather than elated by the
      discovery, that, except his friend Rienzi, and one of the Colonna, a
      stranger of the RhÃ´ne was more conversant with these antiquities than the
      nobles and natives of the metropolis. <a href="#Flink71note-67" id="Flink71noteref-67" name="Flink71noteref-67">67</a> The ignorance and
      credulity of the Romans are elaborately displayed in the old survey of the
      city which was composed about the beginning of the thirteenth century;
      and, without dwelling on the manifold errors of name and place, the legend
      of the Capitol <a href="#Flink71note-68" id="Flink71noteref-68" name="Flink71noteref-68">68</a> may provoke a smile of contempt and
      indignation. "The Capitol," says the anonymous writer, "is so named as
      being the head of the world; where the consuls and senators formerly
      resided for the government of the city and the globe. The strong and lofty
      walls were covered with glass and gold, and crowned with a roof of the
      richest and most curious carving. Below the citadel stood a palace, of
      gold for the greatest part, decorated with precious stones, and whose
      value might be esteemed at one third of the world itself. The statues of
      all the provinces were arranged in order, each with a small bell suspended
      from its neck; and such was the contrivance of art magic, <a href="#Flink71note-69" id="Flink71noteref-69" name="Flink71noteref-69">69</a>
      that if the province rebelled against Rome, the statue turned round to
      that quarter of the heavens, the bell rang, the prophet of the Capitol
      repeated the prodigy, and the senate was admonished of the impending
      danger." A second example, of less importance, though of equal absurdity,
      may be drawn from the two marble horses, led by two naked youths, who have
      since been transported from the baths of Constantine to the Quirinal hill.
      The groundless application of the names of Phidias and Praxiteles may
      perhaps be excused; but these Grecian sculptors should not have been
      removed above four hundred years from the age of Pericles to that of
      Tiberius; they should not have been transferred into two philosophers or
      magicians, whose nakedness was the symbol of truth or knowledge, who
      revealed to the emperor his most secret actions; and, after refusing all
      pecuniary recompense, solicited the honor of leaving this eternal monument
      of themselves. <a href="#Flink71note-70" id="Flink71noteref-70" name="Flink71noteref-70">70</a> Thus awake to the power of magic, the Romans
      were insensible to the beauties of art: no more than five statues were
      visible to the eyes of Poggius; and of the multitudes which chance or
      design had buried under the ruins, the resurrection was fortunately
      delayed till a safer and more enlightened age. <a href="#Flink71note-71" id="Flink71noteref-71" name="Flink71noteref-71">71</a> The Nile which now
      adorns the Vatican, had been explored by some laborers in digging a
      vineyard near the temple, or convent, of the Minerva; but the impatient
      proprietor, who was tormented by some visits of curiosity, restored the
      unprofitable marble to its former grave. <a href="#Flink71note-72" id="Flink71noteref-72" name="Flink71noteref-72">72</a> The discovery of a
      statue of Pompey, ten feet in length, was the occasion of a lawsuit. It
      had been found under a partition wall: the equitable judge had pronounced,
      that the head should be separated from the body to satisfy the claims of
      the contiguous owners; and the sentence would have been executed, if the
      intercession of a cardinal, and the liberality of a pope, had not rescued

      But the clouds of barbarism were gradually dispelled; and the peaceful
      authority of Martin the Fifth and his successors restored the ornaments of
      the city as well as the order of the ecclesiastical state. The
      improvements of Rome, since the fifteenth century, have not been the
      spontaneous produce of freedom and industry. The first and most natural
      root of a great city is the labor and populousness of the adjacent
      country, which supplies the materials of subsistence, of manufactures, and
      of foreign trade. But the greater part of the Campagna of Rome is reduced
      to a dreary and desolate wilderness: the overgrown estates of the princes
      and the clergy are cultivated by the lazy hands of indigent and hopeless
      vassals; and the scanty harvests are confined or exported for the benefit
      of a monopoly. A second and more artificial cause of the growth of a
      metropolis is the residence of a monarch, the expense of a luxurious
      court, and the tributes of dependent provinces. Those provinces and
      tributes had been lost in the fall of the empire; and if some streams of
      the silver of Peru and the gold of Brazil have been attracted by the
      Vatican, the revenues of the cardinals, the fees of office, the oblations
      of pilgrims and clients, and the remnant of ecclesiastical taxes, afford a
      poor and precarious supply, which maintains, however, the idleness of the
      court and city. The population of Rome, far below the measure of the great
      capitals of Europe, does not exceed one hundred and seventy thousand
      inhabitants; <a href="#Flink71note-74" id="Flink71noteref-74" name="Flink71noteref-74">74</a> and within the spacious enclosure of the
      walls, the largest portion of the seven hills is overspread with vineyards
      and ruins. The beauty and splendor of the modern city may be ascribed to
      the abuses of the government, to the influence of superstition. Each reign
      (the exceptions are rare) has been marked by the rapid elevation of a new
      family, enriched by the childish pontiff at the expense of the church and
      country. The palaces of these fortunate nephews are the most costly
      monuments of elegance and servitude: the perfect arts of architecture,
      sculpture, and painting, have been prostituted in their service; and their
      galleries and gardens are decorated with the most precious works of
      antiquity, which taste or vanity has prompted them to collect. The
      ecclesiastical revenues were more decently employed by the popes
      themselves in the pomp of the Catholic worship; but it is superfluous to
      enumerate their pious foundations of altars, chapels, and churches, since
      these lesser stars are eclipsed by the sun of the Vatican, by the dome of
      St. Peter, the most glorious structure that ever has been applied to the
      use of religion. The fame of Julius the Second, Leo the Tenth, and Sixtus
      the Fifth, is accompanied by the superior merit of Bramante and Fontana,
      of Raphael and Michael Angelo; and the same munificence which had been
      displayed in palaces and temples was directed with equal zeal to revive
      and emulate the labors of antiquity. Prostrate obelisks were raised from
      the ground, and erected in the most conspicuous places; of the eleven
      aqueducts of the Cæsars and consuls, three were restored; the artificial
      rivers were conducted over a long series of old, or of new arches, to
      discharge into marble basins a flood of salubrious and refreshing waters:
      and the spectator, impatient to ascend the steps of St. Peter's, is
      detained by a column of Egyptian granite, which rises between two lofty
      and perpetual fountains, to the height of one hundred and twenty feet. The
      map, the description, the monuments of ancient Rome, have been elucidated
      by the diligence of the antiquarian and the student: <a href="#Flink71note-75" id="Flink71noteref-75" name="Flink71noteref-75">75</a>
      and the footsteps of heroes, the relics, not of superstition, but of
      empire, are devoutly visited by a new race of pilgrims from the remote,
      and once savage countries of the North.

      inhabitants of Rome (without including eight or ten thousand Jews,)
      amounted to 138,568 souls, (Labat Voyages en Espagne et en Italie, tom.
      iii. p. 217, 218.) In 1740, they had increased to 146,080; and in 1765, I
      left them, without the Jews 161,899. I am ignorant whether they have since
      continued in a progressive state.]

      distributes his own observations into twenty days; he should have styled
      them weeks, or months, of his visits to the different parts of the city,
      (Diarium Italicum, c. 8—20, p. 104—301.) That learned
      Benedictine reviews the topographers of ancient Rome; the first efforts of
      Blondus, Fulvius, Martianus, and Faunus, the superior labors of Pyrrhus
      Ligorius, had his learning been equal to his labors; the writings of
      Onuphrius Panvinius, qui omnes obscuravit, and the recent but imperfect
      books of Donatus and Nardini. Yet Montfaucon still sighs for a more
      complete plan and description of the old city, which must be attained by
      the three following methods: 1. The measurement of the space and intervals
      of the ruins. 2. The study of inscriptions, and the places where they were
      found. 3. The investigation of all the acts, charters, diaries of the
      middle ages, which name any spot or building of Rome. The laborious work,
      such as Montfaucon desired, must be promoted by princely or public
      munificence: but the great modern plan of Nolli (A.D. 1748) would furnish
      a solid and accurate basis for the ancient topography of Rome.]

      Of these pilgrims, and of every reader, the attention will be excited by a
      History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire; the greatest,
      perhaps, and most awful scene in the history of mankind. The various
      causes and progressive effects are connected with many of the events most
      interesting in human annals: the artful policy of the Cæsars, who long
      maintained the name and image of a free republic; the disorders of
      military despotism; the rise, establishment, and sects of Christianity;
      the foundation of Constantinople; the division of the monarchy; the
      invasion and settlements of the Barbarians of Germany and Scythia; the
      institutions of the civil law; the character and religion of Mahomet; the
      temporal sovereignty of the popes; the restoration and decay of the
      Western empire of Charlemagne; the crusades of the Latins in the East: the
      conquests of the Saracens and Turks; the ruin of the Greek empire; the
      state and revolutions of Rome in the middle age. The historian may applaud
      the importance and variety of his subject; but while he is conscious of
      his own imperfections, he must often accuse the deficiency of his
      materials. It was among the ruins of the Capitol that I first conceived
      the idea of a work which has amused and exercised near twenty years of my
      life, and which, however inadequate to my own wishes, I finally deliver
      to the curiosity and candor of the public.
