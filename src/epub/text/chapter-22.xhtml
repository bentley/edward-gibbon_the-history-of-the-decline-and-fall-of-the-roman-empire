      Chapter XXII: Julian Declared Emperor.

     Julian Is Declared Emperor By The Legions Of Gaul.—His
     March And Success.—The Death Of Constantius.—Civil
     Administration Of Julian.
</pre>
<p>
      While the Romans languished under the ignominious tyranny of eunuchs and
      bishops, the praises of Julian were repeated with transport in every part
      of the empire, except in the palace of Constantius. The barbarians of
      Germany had felt, and still dreaded, the arms of the young Caesar; his
      soldiers were the companions of his victory; the grateful provincials
      enjoyed the blessings of his reign; but the favorites, who had opposed his
      elevation, were offended by his virtues; and they justly considered the
      friend of the people as the enemy of the court. As long as the fame of
      Julian was doubtful, the buffoons of the palace, who were skilled in the
      language of satire, tried the efficacy of those arts which they had so
      often practised with success. They easily discovered, that his simplicity
      was not exempt from affectation: the ridiculous epithets of a hairy
      savage, of an ape invested with the purple, were applied to the dress and
      person of the philosophic warrior; and his modest despatches were
      stigmatized as the vain and elaborate fictions of a loquacious Greek, a
      speculative soldier, who had studied the art of war amidst the groves of
      the academy. <a href="#Blink22note-1" id="Blink22noteref-1" name="Blink22noteref-1">1</a> The voice of malicious folly was at length
      silenced by the shouts of victory; the conqueror of the Franks and
      Alemanni could no longer be painted as an object of contempt; and the
      monarch himself was meanly ambitious of stealing from his lieutenant the
      honorable reward of his labors. In the letters crowned with laurel, which,
      according to ancient custom, were addressed to the provinces, the name of
      Julian was omitted. "Constantius had made his dispositions in person; he
      had signalized his valor in the foremost ranks; his military conduct had
      secured the victory; and the captive king of the barbarians was presented
      to him on the field of battle," from which he was at that time distant
      about forty days' journey. <a href="#Blink22note-2" id="Blink22noteref-2" name="Blink22noteref-2">2</a> So extravagant a fable was incapable, however,
      of deceiving the public credulity, or even of satisfying the pride of the
      emperor himself. Secretly conscious that the applause and favor of the
      Romans accompanied the rising fortunes of Julian, his discontented mind
      was prepared to receive the subtle poison of those artful sycophants, who
      colored their mischievous designs with the fairest appearances of truth
      and candor. <a href="#Blink22note-3" id="Blink22noteref-3" name="Blink22noteref-3">3</a> Instead of depreciating the merits of Julian,
      they acknowledged, and even exaggerated, his popular fame, superior
      talents, and important services. But they darkly insinuated, that the
      virtues of the Caesar might instantly be converted into the most dangerous
      crimes, if the inconstant multitude should prefer their inclinations to
      their duty; or if the general of a victorious army should be tempted from
      his allegiance by the hopes of revenge and independent greatness. The
      personal fears of Constantius were interpreted by his council as a
      laudable anxiety for the public safety; whilst in private, and perhaps in
      his own breast, he disguised, under the less odious appellation of fear,
      the sentiments of hatred and envy, which he had secretly conceived for the
      inimitable virtues of Julian.

<p>
      The apparent tranquillity of Gaul, and the imminent danger of the eastern
      provinces, offered a specious pretence for the design which was artfully
      concerted by the Imperial ministers. They resolved to disarm the Caesar;
      to recall those faithful troops who guarded his person and dignity; and to
      employ, in a distant war against the Persian monarch, the hardy veterans
      who had vanquished, on the banks of the Rhine, the fiercest nations of
      Germany. While Julian used the laborious hours of his winter quarters at
      Paris in the administration of power, which, in his hands, was the
      exercise of virtue, he was surprised by the hasty arrival of a tribune and
      a notary, with positive orders, from the emperor, which they were directed
      to execute, and he was commanded not to oppose. Constantius signified his
      pleasure, that four entire legions, the Celtae, and Petulants, the Heruli,
      and the Batavians, should be separated from the standard of Julian, under
      which they had acquired their fame and discipline; that in each of the
      remaining bands three hundred of the bravest youths should be selected;
      and that this numerous detachment, the strength of the Gallic army, should
      instantly begin their march, and exert their utmost diligence to arrive,
      before the opening of the campaign, on the frontiers of Persia. <a href="#Blink22note-4" id="Blink22noteref-4" name="Blink22noteref-4">4</a> The
      Caesar foresaw and lamented the consequences of this fatal mandate. Most
      of the auxiliaries, who engaged their voluntary service, had stipulated,
      that they should never be obliged to pass the Alps. The public faith of
      Rome, and the personal honor of Julian, had been pledged for the
      observance of this condition. Such an act of treachery and oppression
      would destroy the confidence, and excite the resentment, of the
      independent warriors of Germany, who considered truth as the noblest of
      their virtues, and freedom as the most valuable of their possessions. The
      legionaries, who enjoyed the title and privileges of Romans, were enlisted
      for the general defence of the republic; but those mercenary troops heard
      with cold indifference the antiquated names of the republic and of Rome.
      Attached, either from birth or long habit, to the climate and manners of
      Gaul, they loved and admired Julian; they despised, and perhaps hated, the
      emperor; they dreaded the laborious march, the Persian arrows, and the
      burning deserts of Asia. They claimed as their own the country which they
      had saved; and excused their want of spirit, by pleading the sacred and
      more immediate duty of protecting their families and friends.
    </p>
<p>
      The apprehensions of the Gauls were derived from the knowledge of the
      impending and inevitable danger. As soon as the provinces were exhausted
      of their military strength, the Germans would violate a treaty which had
      been imposed on their fears; and notwithstanding the abilities and valor
      of Julian, the general of a nominal army, to whom the public calamities
      would be imputed, must find himself, after a vain resistance, either a
      prisoner in the camp of the barbarians, or a criminal in the palace of
      Constantius. If Julian complied with the orders which he had received, he
      subscribed his own destruction, and that of a people who deserved his
      affection. But a positive refusal was an act of rebellion, and a
      declaration of war. The inexorable jealousy of the emperor, the
      peremptory, and perhaps insidious, nature of his commands, left not any
      room for a fair apology, or candid interpretation; and the dependent
      station of the Caesar scarcely allowed him to pause or to deliberate.
      Solitude increased the perplexity of Julian; he could no longer apply to
      the faithful counsels of Sallust, who had been removed from his office by
      the judicious malice of the eunuchs: he could not even enforce his
      representations by the concurrence of the ministers, who would have been
      afraid or ashamed to approve the ruin of Gaul. The moment had been chosen,
      when Lupicinus, <a href="#Blink22note-5" id="Blink22noteref-5" name="Blink22noteref-5">5</a> the general of the cavalry, was despatched into
      Britain, to repulse the inroads of the Scots and Picts; and Florentius was
      occupied at Vienna by the assessment of the tribute. The latter, a crafty
      and corrupt statesman, declining to assume a responsible part on this
      dangerous occasion, eluded the pressing and repeated invitations of
      Julian, who represented to him, that in every important measure, the
      presence of the praefect was indispensable in the council of the prince.
      In the mean while the Caesar was oppressed by the rude and importunate
      solicitations of the Imperial messengers, who presumed to suggest, that if
      he expected the return of his ministers, he would charge himself with the
      guilt of the delay, and reserve for them the merit of the execution.
      Unable to resist, unwilling to comply, Julian expressed, in the most
      serious terms, his wish, and even his intention, of resigning the purple,
      which he could not preserve with honor, but which he could not abdicate
      with safety.

      which may be interposed, between the hyeme adulta and the primo vere of
      Ammianus, (xx. l. 4,) instead of allowing a sufficient space for a march
      of three thousand miles, would render the orders of Constantius as
      extravagant as they were unjust. The troops of Gaul could not have reached
      Syria till the end of autumn. The memory of Ammianus must have been
      inaccurate, and his language incorrect. * Note: The late editor of
      Ammianus attempts to vindicate his author from the charge of inaccuracy.
      "It is clear, from the whole course of the narrative, that Constantius
      entertained this design of demanding his troops from Julian, immediately
      after the taking of Amida, in the autumn of the preceding year, and had
      transmitted his orders into Gaul, before it was known that Lupicinus had
      gone into Britain with the Herulians and Batavians." Wagner, note to Amm.

      incorrectness in his language at least.—M]

      valor of Lupicinus, and his military skill, are acknowledged by the
      historian, who, in his affected language, accuses the general of exalting
      the horns of his pride, bellowing in a tragic tone, and exciting a doubt
      whether he was more cruel or avaricious. The danger from the Scots and
      Picts was so serious that Julian himself had some thoughts of passing over
      into the island.]
    </p>
<p>
      After a painful conflict, Julian was compelled to acknowledge, that
      obedience was the virtue of the most eminent subject, and that the
      sovereign alone was entitled to judge of the public welfare. He issued the
      necessary orders for carrying into execution the commands of Constantius;
      a part of the troops began their march for the Alps; and the detachments
      from the several garrisons moved towards their respective places of
      assembly. They advanced with difficulty through the trembling and
      affrighted crowds of provincials, who attempted to excite their pity by
      silent despair, or loud lamentations, while the wives of the soldiers,
      holding their infants in their arms, accused the desertion of their
      husbands, in the mixed language of grief, of tenderness, and of
      indignation. This scene of general distress afflicted the humanity of the
      Caesar; he granted a sufficient number of post-wagons to transport the
      wives and families of the soldiers, <a href="#Blink22note-6" id="Blink22noteref-6" name="Blink22noteref-6">6</a> endeavored to alleviate
      the hardships which he was constrained to inflict, and increased, by the
      most laudable arts, his own popularity, and the discontent of the exiled
      troops. The grief of an armed multitude is soon converted into rage; their
      licentious murmurs, which every hour were communicated from tent to tent
      with more boldness and effect, prepared their minds for the most daring
      acts of sedition; and by the connivance of their tribunes, a seasonable
      libel was secretly dispersed, which painted in lively colors the disgrace
      of the Caesar, the oppression of the Gallic army, and the feeble vices of
      the tyrant of Asia. The servants of Constantius were astonished and
      alarmed by the progress of this dangerous spirit. They pressed the Caesar
      to hasten the departure of the troops; but they imprudently rejected the
      honest and judicious advice of Julian; who proposed that they should not
      march through Paris, and suggested the danger and temptation of a last
      interview.

      often mentioned in the Code, and were supposed to carry fifteen hundred
      pounds weight. See Vales. ad Ammian. xx. 4.]
    </p>
<p>
      As soon as the approach of the troops was announced, the Caesar went out
      to meet them, and ascended his tribunal, which had been erected in a plain
      before the gates of the city. After distinguishing the officers and
      soldiers, who by their rank or merit deserved a peculiar attention, Julian
      addressed himself in a studied oration to the surrounding multitude: he
      celebrated their exploits with grateful applause; encouraged them to
      accept, with alacrity, the honor of serving under the eye of a powerful
      and liberal monarch; and admonished them, that the commands of Augustus
      required an instant and cheerful obedience. The soldiers, who were
      apprehensive of offending their general by an indecent clamor, or of
      belying their sentiments by false and venal acclamations, maintained an
      obstinate silence; and after a short pause, were dismissed to their
      quarters. The principal officers were entertained by the Caesar, who
      professed, in the warmest language of friendship, his desire and his
      inability to reward, according to their deserts, the brave companions of
      his victories. They retired from the feast, full of grief and perplexity;
      and lamented the hardship of their fate, which tore them from their
      beloved general and their native country. The only expedient which could
      prevent their separation was boldly agitated and approved the popular
      resentment was insensibly moulded into a regular conspiracy; their just
      reasons of complaint were heightened by passion, and their passions were
      inflamed by wine; as, on the eve of their departure, the troops were
      indulged in licentious festivity. At the hour of midnight, the impetuous
      multitude, with swords, and bows, and torches in their hands, rushed into
      the suburbs; encompassed the palace; <a href="#Blink22note-7" id="Blink22noteref-7" name="Blink22noteref-7">7</a> and, careless of future
      dangers, pronounced the fatal and irrevocable words, Julian Augustus! The
      prince, whose anxious suspense was interrupted by their disorderly
      acclamations, secured the doors against their intrusion; and as long as it
      was in his power, secluded his person and dignity from the accidents of a
      nocturnal tumult. At the dawn of day, the soldiers, whose zeal was
      irritated by opposition, forcibly entered the palace, seized, with
      respectful violence, the object of their choice, guarded Julian with drawn
      swords through the streets of Paris, placed him on the tribunal, and with
      repeated shouts saluted him as their emperor. Prudence, as well as
      loyalty, inculcated the propriety of resisting their treasonable designs;
      and of preparing, for his oppressed virtue, the excuse of violence.
      Addressing himself by turns to the multitude and to individuals, he
      sometimes implored their mercy, and sometimes expressed his indignation;
      conjured them not to sully the fame of their immortal victories; and
      ventured to promise, that if they would immediately return to their
      allegiance, he would undertake to obtain from the emperor not only a free
      and gracious pardon, but even the revocation of the orders which had
      excited their resentment. But the soldiers, who were conscious of their
      guilt, chose rather to depend on the gratitude of Julian, than on the
      clemency of the emperor. Their zeal was insensibly turned into impatience,
      and their impatience into rage. The inflexible Caesar sustained, till the
      third hour of the day, their prayers, their reproaches, and their menaces;
      nor did he yield, till he had been repeatedly assured, that if he wished
      to live, he must consent to reign. He was exalted on a shield in the
      presence, and amidst the unanimous acclamations, of the troops; a rich
      military collar, which was offered by chance, supplied the want of a
      diadem; <a href="#Blink22note-8" id="Blink22noteref-8" name="Blink22noteref-8">8</a>
      the ceremony was concluded by the promise of a moderate donative; and the
      new emperor, overwhelmed with real or affected grief retired into the most
      secret recesses of his apartment. <a href="#Blink22note-10" id="Blink22noteref-10" name="Blink22noteref-10">10</a>

      himself, (ad S. P. Q. Atheniensem, p. 282, 283, 284,) Libanius, (Orat.
      Parental. c. 44-48, in Fabricius, Bibliot. Graec. tom. vii. p. 269-273,)

      reign of Julian, appears to follow the more respectable authority of
      Eunapius. With such guides we might neglect the abbreviators and
      ecclesiastical historians.]
    </p>
<p>
      The grief of Julian could proceed only from his innocence; out his
      innocence must appear extremely doubtful <a href="#Blink22note-11" id="Blink22noteref-11" name="Blink22noteref-11">11</a> in the eyes of those
      who have learned to suspect the motives and the professions of princes.
      His lively and active mind was susceptible of the various impressions of
      hope and fear, of gratitude and revenge, of duty and of ambition, of the
      love of fame, and of the fear of reproach. But it is impossible for us to
      calculate the respective weight and operation of these sentiments; or to
      ascertain the principles of action which might escape the observation,
      while they guided, or rather impelled, the steps of Julian himself. The
      discontent of the troops was produced by the malice of his enemies; their
      tumult was the natural effect of interest and of passion; and if Julian
      had tried to conceal a deep design under the appearances of chance, he
      must have employed the most consummate artifice without necessity, and
      probably without success. He solemnly declares, in the presence of
      Jupiter, of the Sun, of Mars, of Minerva, and of all the other deities,
      that till the close of the evening which preceded his elevation, he was
      utterly ignorant of the designs of the soldiers; <a href="#Blink22note-12" id="Blink22noteref-12" name="Blink22noteref-12">12</a> and it may seem
      ungenerous to distrust the honor of a hero and the truth of a philosopher.
      Yet the superstitious confidence that Constantius was the enemy, and that
      he himself was the favorite, of the gods, might prompt him to desire, to
      solicit, and even to hasten the auspicious moment of his reign, which was
      predestined to restore the ancient religion of mankind. When Julian had
      received the intelligence of the conspiracy, he resigned himself to a
      short slumber; and afterwards related to his friends that he had seen the
      genius of the empire waiting with some impatience at his door, pressing
      for admittance, and reproaching his want of spirit and ambition. <a href="#Blink22note-13" id="Blink22noteref-13" name="Blink22noteref-13">13</a>
      Astonished and perplexed, he addressed his prayers to the great Jupiter,
      who immediately signified, by a clear and manifest omen, that he should
      submit to the will of heaven and of the army. The conduct which disclaims
      the ordinary maxims of reason, excites our suspicion and eludes our
      inquiry. Whenever the spirit of fanaticism, at once so credulous and so
      crafty, has insinuated itself into a noble mind, it insensibly corrodes
      the vital principles of virtue and veracity.

      To moderate the zeal of his party, to protect the persons of his enemies,
      <a href="#Blink22note-14" id="Blink22noteref-14" name="Blink22noteref-14">14</a>
      to defeat and to despise the secret enterprises which were formed against
      his life and dignity, were the cares which employed the first days of the
      reign of the new emperor. Although he was firmly resolved to maintain the
      station which he had assumed, he was still desirous of saving his country
      from the calamities of civil war, of declining a contest with the superior
      forces of Constantius, and of preserving his own character from the
      reproach of perfidy and ingratitude. Adorned with the ensigns of military
      and imperial pomp, Julian showed himself in the field of Mars to the
      soldiers, who glowed with ardent enthusiasm in the cause of their pupil,
      their leader, and their friend. He recapitulated their victories, lamented
      their sufferings, applauded their resolution, animated their hopes, and
      checked their impetuosity; nor did he dismiss the assembly, till he had
      obtained a solemn promise from the troops, that if the emperor of the East
      would subscribe an equitable treaty, they would renounce any views of
      conquest, and satisfy themselves with the tranquil possession of the
      Gallic provinces. On this foundation he composed, in his own name, and in
      that of the army, a specious and moderate epistle, <a href="#Blink22note-15" id="Blink22noteref-15" name="Blink22noteref-15">15</a> which was delivered
      to Pentadius, his master of the offices, and to his chamberlain Eutherius;
      two ambassadors whom he appointed to receive the answer, and observe the
      dispositions of Constantius. This epistle is inscribed with the modest
      appellation of Caesar; but Julian solicits in a peremptory, though
      respectful, manner, the confirmation of the title of Augustus. He
      acknowledges the irregularity of his own election, while he justifies, in
      some measure, the resentment and violence of the troops which had extorted
      his reluctant consent. He allows the supremacy of his brother Constantius;
      and engages to send him an annual present of Spanish horses, to recruit
      his army with a select number of barbarian youths, and to accept from his
      choice a Praetorian praefect of approved discretion and fidelity. But he
      reserves for himself the nomination of his other civil and military
      officers, with the troops, the revenue, and the sovereignty of the
      provinces beyond the Alps. He admonishes the emperor to consult the
      dictates of justice; to distrust the arts of those venal flatterers, who
      subsist only by the discord of princes; and to embrace the offer of a fair
      and honorable treaty, equally advantageous to the republic and to the
      house of Constantine. In this negotiation Julian claimed no more than he
      already possessed. The delegated authority which he had long exercised
      over the provinces of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, was still obeyed under a
      name more independent and august. The soldiers and the people rejoiced in
      a revolution which was not stained even with the blood of the guilty.
      Florentius was a fugitive; Lupicinus a prisoner. The persons who were
      disaffected to the new government were disarmed and secured; and the
      vacant offices were distributed, according to the recommendation of merit,
      by a prince who despised the intrigues of the palace, and the clamors of
      the soldiers. <a href="#Blink22note-16" id="Blink22noteref-16" name="Blink22noteref-16">16</a>

      The negotiations of peace were accompanied and supported by the most
      vigorous preparations for war. The army, which Julian held in readiness
      for immediate action, was recruited and augmented by the disorders of the
      times. The cruel persecutions of the faction of Magnentius had filled Gaul
      with numerous bands of outlaws and robbers. They cheerfully accepted the
      offer of a general pardon from a prince whom they could trust, submitted
      to the restraints of military discipline, and retained only their
      implacable hatred to the person and government of Constantius. <a href="#Blink22note-17" id="Blink22noteref-17" name="Blink22noteref-17">17</a>
      As soon as the season of the year permitted Julian to take the field, he
      appeared at the head of his legions; threw a bridge over the Rhine in the
      neighborhood of Cleves; and prepared to chastise the perfidy of the
      Attuarii, a tribe of Franks, who presumed that they might ravage, with
      impunity, the frontiers of a divided empire. The difficulty, as well as
      glory, of this enterprise, consisted in a laborious march; and Julian had
      conquered, as soon as he could penetrate into a country, which former
      princes had considered as inaccessible. After he had given peace to the
      Barbarians, the emperor carefully visited the fortifications along the
      Qhine from Cleves to Basil; surveyed, with peculiar attention, the
      territories which he had recovered from the hands of the Alemanni, passed
      through Besancon, <a href="#Blink22note-18" id="Blink22noteref-18" name="Blink22noteref-18">18</a> which had severely suffered from their fury,
      and fixed his headquarters at Vienna for the ensuing winter. The barrier
      of Gaul was improved and strengthened with additional fortifications; and
      Julian entertained some hopes that the Germans, whom he had so often
      vanquished, might, in his absence, be restrained by the terror of his
      name. Vadomair <a href="#Blink22note-19" id="Blink22noteref-19" name="Blink22noteref-19">19</a> was the only prince of the Alemanni whom he
      esteemed or feared and while the subtle Barbarian affected to observe the
      faith of treaties, the progress of his arms threatened the state with an
      unseasonable and dangerous war. The policy of Julian condescended to
      surprise the prince of the Alemanni by his own arts: and Vadomair, who, in
      the character of a friend, had incautiously accepted an invitation from
      the Roman governors, was seized in the midst of the entertainment, and
      sent away prisoner into the heart of Spain. Before the Barbarians were
      recovered from their amazement, the emperor appeared in arms on the banks
      of the Rhine, and, once more crossing the river, renewed the deep
      impressions of terror and respect which had been already made by four
      preceding expeditions. <a href="#Blink22note-20" id="Blink22noteref-20" name="Blink22noteref-20">20</a>

      The ambassadors of Julian had been instructed to execute, with the utmost
      diligence, their important commission. But, in their passage through Italy
      and Illyricum, they were detained by the tedious and affected delays of
      the provincial governors; they were conducted by slow journeys from
      Constantinople to Caesarea in Cappadocia; and when at length they were
      admitted to the presence of Constantius, they found that he had already
      conceived, from the despatches of his own officers, the most unfavorable
      opinion of the conduct of Julian, and of the Gallic army. The letters were
      heard with impatience; the trembling messengers were dismissed with
      indignation and contempt; and the looks, gestures, the furious language of
      the monarch, expressed the disorder of his soul. The domestic connection,
      which might have reconciled the brother and the husband of Helena, was
      recently dissolved by the death of that princess, whose pregnancy had been
      several times fruitless, and was at last fatal to herself. <a href="#Blink22note-21" id="Blink22noteref-21" name="Blink22noteref-21">21</a>
      The empress Eusebia had preserved, to the last moment of her life, the
      warm, and even jealous, affection which she had conceived for Julian; and
      her mild influence might have moderated the resentment of a prince, who,
      since her death, was abandoned to his own passions, and to the arts of his
      eunuchs. But the terror of a foreign invasion obliged him to suspend the
      punishment of a private enemy: he continued his march towards the confines
      of Persia, and thought it sufficient to signify the conditions which might
      entitle Julian and his guilty followers to the clemency of their offended
      sovereign. He required, that the presumptuous Caesar should expressly
      renounce the appellation and rank of Augustus, which he had accepted from
      the rebels; that he should descend to his former station of a limited and
      dependent minister; that he should vest the powers of the state and army
      in the hands of those officers who were appointed by the Imperial court;
      and that he should trust his safety to the assurances of pardon, which
      were announced by Epictetus, a Gallic bishop, and one of the Arian
      favorites of Constantius. Several months were ineffectually consumed in a
      treaty which was negotiated at the distance of three thousand miles
      between Paris and Antioch; and, as soon as Julian perceived that his
      modest and respectful behavior served only to irritate the pride of an
      implacable adversary, he boldly resolved to commit his life and fortune to
      the chance of a civil war. He gave a public and military audience to the
      quaestor Leonas: the haughty epistle of Constantius was read to the
      attentive multitude; and Julian protested, with the most flattering
      deference, that he was ready to resign the title of Augustus, if he could
      obtain the consent of those whom he acknowledged as the authors of his
      elevation. The faint proposal was impetuously silenced; and the
      acclamations of "Julian Augustus, continue to reign, by the authority of
      the army, of the people, of the republic which you have saved," thundered
      at once from every part of the field, and terrified the pale ambassador of
      Constantius. A part of the letter was afterwards read, in which the
      emperor arraigned the ingratitude of Julian, whom he had invested with the
      honors of the purple; whom he had educated with so much care and
      tenderness; whom he had preserved in his infancy, when he was left a
      helpless orphan.
    </p>
<p>
      "An orphan!" interrupted Julian, who justified his cause by indulging his
      passions: "does the assassin of my family reproach me that I was left an
      orphan? He urges me to revenge those injuries which I have long studied to
      forget." The assembly was dismissed; and Leonas, who, with some
      difficulty, had been protected from the popular fury, was sent back to his
      master with an epistle, in which Julian expressed, in a strain of the most
      vehement eloquence, the sentiments of contempt, of hatred, and of
      resentment, which had been suppressed and imbittered by the dissimulation
      of twenty years. After this message, which might be considered as a signal
      of irreconcilable war, Julian, who, some weeks before, had celebrated the
      Christian festival of the Epiphany, <a href="#Blink22note-22" id="Blink22noteref-22" name="Blink22noteref-22">22</a> made a public
      declaration that he committed the care of his safety to the Immortal Gods;
      and thus publicly renounced the religion as well as the friendship of
      Constantius. <a href="#Blink22note-23" id="Blink22noteref-23" name="Blink22noteref-23">23</a>

<p>
      The situation of Julian required a vigorous and immediate resolution. He
      had discovered, from intercepted letters, that his adversary, sacrificing
      the interest of the state to that of the monarch, had again excited the
      Barbarians to invade the provinces of the West. The position of two
      magazines, one of them collected on the banks of the Lake of Constance,
      the other formed at the foot of the Cottian Alps, seemed to indicate the
      march of two armies; and the size of those magazines, each of which
      consisted of six hundred thousand quarters of wheat, or rather flour, <a href="#Blink22note-24" id="Blink22noteref-24" name="Blink22noteref-24">24</a>
      was a threatening evidence of the strength and numbers of the enemy who
      prepared to surround him. But the Imperial legions were still in their
      distant quarters of Asia; the Danube was feebly guarded; and if Julian
      could occupy, by a sudden incursion, the important provinces of Illyricum,
      he might expect that a people of soldiers would resort to his standard,
      and that the rich mines of gold and silver would contribute to the
      expenses of the civil war. He proposed this bold enterprise to the
      assembly of the soldiers; inspired them with a just confidence in their
      general, and in themselves; and exhorted them to maintain their reputation
      of being terrible to the enemy, moderate to their fellow-citizens, and
      obedient to their officers. His spirited discourse was received with the
      loudest acclamations, and the same troops which had taken up arms against
      Constantius, when he summoned them to leave Gaul, now declared with
      alacrity, that they would follow Julian to the farthest extremities of
      Europe or Asia. The oath of fidelity was administered; and the soldiers,
      clashing their shields, and pointing their drawn swords to their throats,
      devoted themselves, with horrid imprecations, to the service of a leader
      whom they celebrated as the deliverer of Gaul and the conqueror of the
      Germans. <a href="#Blink22note-25" id="Blink22noteref-25" name="Blink22noteref-25">25</a> This solemn engagement, which seemed to be
      dictated by affection rather than by duty, was singly opposed by
      Nebridius, who had been admitted to the office of Praetorian praefect.
      That faithful minister, alone and unassisted, asserted the rights of
      Constantius, in the midst of an armed and angry multitude, to whose fury
      he had almost fallen an honorable, but useless sacrifice. After losing one
      of his hands by the stroke of a sword, he embraced the knees of the prince
      whom he had offended. Julian covered the praefect with his Imperial
      mantle, and, protecting him from the zeal of his followers, dismissed him
      to his own house, with less respect than was perhaps due to the virtue of
      an enemy. <a href="#Blink22note-26" id="Blink22noteref-26" name="Blink22noteref-26">26</a> The high office of Nebridius was bestowed on
      Sallust; and the provinces of Gaul, which were now delivered from the
      intolerable oppression of taxes, enjoyed the mild and equitable
      administration of the friend of Julian, who was permitted to practise
      those virtues which he had instilled into the mind of his pupil. <a href="#Blink22note-27" id="Blink22noteref-27" name="Blink22noteref-27">27</a>

      and divided his army. <a href="#Blink22note-28" id="Blink22noteref-28" name="Blink22noteref-28">28</a> One body, which consisted of ten thousand
      men, was directed under the command of Nevitta, general of the cavalry, to
      advance through the midland parts of Rhaetia and Noricum. A similar
      division of troops, under the orders of Jovius and Jovinus, prepared to
      follow the oblique course of the highways, through the Alps, and the
      northern confines of Italy. The instructions to the generals were
      conceived with energy and precision: to hasten their march in close and
      compact columns, which, according to the disposition of the ground, might
      readily be changed into any order of battle; to secure themselves against
      the surprises of the night by strong posts and vigilant guards; to prevent
      resistance by their unexpected arrival; to elude examination by their
      sudden departure; to spread the opinion of their strength, and the terror
      of his name; and to join their sovereign under the walls of Sirmium. For
      himself Julian had reserved a more difficult and extraordinary part. He
      selected three thousand brave and active volunteers, resolved, like their
      leader, to cast behind them every hope of a retreat; at the head of this
      faithful band, he fearlessly plunged into the recesses of the Marcian, or
      Black Forest, which conceals the sources of the Danube; <a href="#Blink22note-29" id="Blink22noteref-29" name="Blink22noteref-29">29</a>
      and, for many days, the fate of Julian was unknown to the world. The
      secrecy of his march, his diligence, and vigor, surmounted every obstacle;
      he forced his way over mountains and morasses, occupied the bridges or
      swam the rivers, pursued his direct course, <a href="#Blink22note-30" id="Blink22noteref-30" name="Blink22noteref-30">30</a> without reflecting
      whether he traversed the territory of the Romans or of the Barbarians, and
      at length emerged, between Ratisbon and Vienna, at the place where he
      designed to embark his troops on the Danube. By a well-concerted
      stratagem, he seized a fleet of light brigantines, <a href="#Blink22note-31" id="Blink22noteref-31" name="Blink22noteref-31">31</a> as it lay at anchor;
      secured a apply of coarse provisions sufficient to satisfy the indelicate,
      and voracious, appetite of a Gallic army; and boldly committed himself to
      the stream of the Danube. The labors of the mariners, who plied their oars
      with incessant diligence, and the steady continuance of a favorable wind,
      carried his fleet above seven hundred miles in eleven days; <a href="#Blink22note-32" id="Blink22noteref-32" name="Blink22noteref-32">32</a>
      and he had already disembarked his troops at Bononia, <a href="#Blink22note-3211" id="Blink22noteref-3211" name="Blink22noteref-3211">3211</a>
      only nineteen miles from Sirmium, before his enemies could receive any
      certain intelligence that he had left the banks of the Rhine. In the
      course of this long and rapid navigation, the mind of Julian was fixed on
      the object of his enterprise; and though he accepted the deputations of
      some cities, which hastened to claim the merit of an early submission, he
      passed before the hostile stations, which were placed along the river,
      without indulging the temptation of signalizing a useless and ill-timed
      valor. The banks of the Danube were crowded on either side with
      spectators, who gazed on the military pomp, anticipated the importance of
      the event, and diffused through the adjacent country the fame of a young
      hero, who advanced with more than mortal speed at the head of the
      innumerable forces of the West. Lucilian, who, with the rank of general of
      the cavalry, commanded the military powers of Illyricum, was alarmed and
      perplexed by the doubtful reports, which he could neither reject nor
      believe. He had taken some slow and irresolute measures for the purpose of
      collecting his troops, when he was surprised by Dagalaiphus, an active
      officer, whom Julian, as soon as he landed at Bononia, had pushed forwards
      with some light infantry. The captive general, uncertain of his life or
      death, was hastily thrown upon a horse, and conducted to the presence of
      Julian; who kindly raised him from the ground, and dispelled the terror
      and amazement which seemed to stupefy his faculties. But Lucilian had no
      sooner recovered his spirits, than he betrayed his want of discretion, by
      presuming to admonish his conqueror that he had rashly ventured, with a
      handful of men, to expose his person in the midst of his enemies. "Reserve
      for your master Constantius these timid remonstrances," replied Julian,
      with a smile of contempt: "when I gave you my purple to kiss, I received
      you not as a counsellor, but as a suppliant." Conscious that success alone
      could justify his attempt, and that boldness only could command success,
      he instantly advanced, at the head of three thousand soldiers, to attack
      the strongest and most populous city of the Illyrian provinces. As he
      entered the long suburb of Sirmium, he was received by the joyful
      acclamations of the army and people; who, crowned with flowers, and
      holding lighted tapers in their hands, conducted their acknowledged
      sovereign to his Imperial residence. Two days were devoted to the public
      joy, which was celebrated by the games of the circus; but, early on the
      morning of the third day, Julian marched to occupy the narrow pass of
      Succi, in the defiles of Mount Haemus; which, almost in the midway between
      Sirmium and Constantinople, separates the provinces of Thrace and Dacia,
      by an abrupt descent towards the former, and a gentle declivity on the
      side of the latter. <a href="#Blink22note-33" id="Blink22noteref-33" name="Blink22noteref-33">33</a> The defence of this important post was
      intrusted to the brave Nevitta; who, as well as the generals of the
      Italian division, successfully executed the plan of the march and junction
      which their master had so ably conceived. <a href="#Blink22note-34" id="Blink22noteref-34" name="Blink22noteref-34">34</a>

      The homage which Julian obtained, from the fears or the inclination of the
      people, extended far beyond the immediate effect of his arms. <a href="#Blink22note-35" id="Blink22noteref-35" name="Blink22noteref-35">35</a>
      The praefectures of Italy and Illyricum were administered by Taurus and
      Florentius, who united that important office with the vain honors of the
      consulship; and as those magistrates had retired with precipitation to the
      court of Asia, Julian, who could not always restrain the levity of his
      temper, stigmatized their flight by adding, in all the Acts of the Year,
      the epithet of fugitive to the names of the two consuls. The provinces
      which had been deserted by their first magistrates acknowledged the
      authority of an emperor, who, conciliating the qualities of a soldier with
      those of a philosopher, was equally admired in the camps of the Danube and
      in the cities of Greece. From his palace, or, more properly, from his
      head-quarters of Sirmium and Naissus, he distributed to the principal
      cities of the empire, a labored apology for his own conduct; published the
      secret despatches of Constantius; and solicited the judgment of mankind
      between two competitors, the one of whom had expelled, and the other had
      invited, the Barbarians. <a href="#Blink22note-36" id="Blink22noteref-36" name="Blink22noteref-36">36</a> Julian, whose mind was deeply wounded by the
      reproach of ingratitude, aspired to maintain, by argument as well as by
      arms, the superior merits of his cause; and to excel, not only in the arts
      of war, but in those of composition. His epistle to the senate and people
      of Athens <a href="#Blink22note-37" id="Blink22noteref-37" name="Blink22noteref-37">37</a> seems to have been dictated by an elegant
      enthusiasm; which prompted him to submit his actions and his motives to
      the degenerate Athenians of his own times, with the same humble deference
      as if he had been pleading, in the days of Aristides, before the tribunal
      of the Areopagus. His application to the senate of Rome, which was still
      permitted to bestow the titles of Imperial power, was agreeable to the
      forms of the expiring republic. An assembly was summoned by Tertullus,
      praefect of the city; the epistle of Julian was read; and, as he appeared
      to be master of Italy his claims were admitted without a dissenting voice.
      His oblique censure of the innovations of Constantine, and his passionate
      invective against the vices of Constantius, were heard with less
      satisfaction; and the senate, as if Julian had been present, unanimously
      exclaimed, "Respect, we beseech you, the author of your own fortune." <a href="#Blink22note-38" id="Blink22noteref-38" name="Blink22noteref-38">38</a>
      An artful expression, which, according to the chance of war, might be
      differently explained; as a manly reproof of the ingratitude of the
      usurper, or as a flattering confession, that a single act of such benefit
      to the state ought to atone for all the failings of Constantius.

      The intelligence of the march and rapid progress of Julian was speedily
      transmitted to his rival, who, by the retreat of Sapor, had obtained some
      respite from the Persian war. Disguising the anguish of his soul under the
      semblance of contempt, Constantius professed his intention of returning
      into Europe, and of giving chase to Julian; for he never spoke of his
      military expedition in any other light than that of a hunting party. <a href="#Blink22note-39" id="Blink22noteref-39" name="Blink22noteref-39">39</a>
      In the camp of Hierapolis, in Syria, he communicated this design to his
      army; slightly mentioned the guilt and rashness of the Caesar; and
      ventured to assure them, that if the mutineers of Gaul presumed to meet
      them in the field, they would be unable to sustain the fire of their eyes,
      and the irresistible weight of their shout of onset. The speech of the
      emperor was received with military applause, and Theodotus, the president
      of the council of Hierapolis, requested, with tears of adulation, that his
      city might be adorned with the head of the vanquished rebel. <a href="#Blink22note-40" id="Blink22noteref-40" name="Blink22noteref-40">40</a>
      A chosen detachment was despatched away in post-wagons, to secure, if it
      were yet possible, the pass of Succi; the recruits, the horses, the arms,
      and the magazines, which had been prepared against Sapor, were
      appropriated to the service of the civil war; and the domestic victories
      of Constantius inspired his partisans with the most sanguine assurances of
      success. The notary Gaudentius had occupied in his name the provinces of
      Africa; the subsistence of Rome was intercepted; and the distress of
      Julian was increased by an unexpected event, which might have been
      productive of fatal consequences. Julian had received the submission of
      two legions and a cohort of archers, who were stationed at Sirmium; but he
      suspected, with reason, the fidelity of those troops which had been
      distinguished by the emperor; and it was thought expedient, under the
      pretence of the exposed state of the Gallic frontier, to dismiss them from
      the most important scene of action. They advanced, with reluctance, as far
      as the confines of Italy; but as they dreaded the length of the way, and
      the savage fierceness of the Germans, they resolved, by the instigation of
      one of their tribunes, to halt at Aquileia, and to erect the banners of
      Constantius on the walls of that impregnable city. The vigilance of Julian
      perceived at once the extent of the mischief, and the necessity of
      applying an immediate remedy. By his order, Jovinus led back a part of the
      army into Italy; and the siege of Aquileia was formed with diligence, and
      prosecuted with vigor. But the legionaries, who seemed to have rejected
      the yoke of discipline, conducted the defence of the place with skill and
      perseverance; vited the rest of Italy to imitate the example of their
      courage and loyalty; and threatened the retreat of Julian, if he should be
      forced to yield to the superior numbers of the armies of the East. <a href="#Blink22note-41" id="Blink22noteref-41" name="Blink22noteref-41">41</a>

      But the humanity of Julian was preserved from the cruel alternative which
      he pathetically laments, of destroying or of being himself destroyed: and
      the seasonable death of Constantius delivered the Roman empire from the
      calamities of civil war. The approach of winter could not detain the
      monarch at Antioch; and his favorites durst not oppose his impatient
      desire of revenge. A slight fever, which was perhaps occasioned by the
      agitation of his spirits, was increased by the fatigues of the journey;
      and Constantius was obliged to halt at the little town of Mopsucrene,
      twelve miles beyond Tarsus, where he expired, after a short illness, in
      the forty-fifth year of his age, and the twenty-fourth of his reign. <a href="#Blink22note-42" id="Blink22noteref-42" name="Blink22noteref-42">42</a>
      His genuine character, which was composed of pride and weakness, of
      superstition and cruelty, has been fully displayed in the preceding
      narrative of civil and ecclesiastical events. The long abuse of power
      rendered him a considerable object in the eyes of his contemporaries; but
      as personal merit can alone deserve the notice of posterity, the last of
      the sons of Constantine may be dismissed from the world, with the remark,
      that he inherited the defects, without the abilities, of his father.
      Before Constantius expired, he is said to have named Julian for his
      successor; nor does it seem improbable, that his anxious concern for the
      fate of a young and tender wife, whom he left with child, may have
      prevailed, in his last moments, over the harsher passions of hatred and
      revenge. Eusebius, and his guilty associates, made a faint attempt to
      prolong the reign of the eunuchs, by the election of another emperor; but
      their intrigues were rejected with disdain, by an army which now abhorred
      the thought of civil discord; and two officers of rank were instantly
      despatched, to assure Julian, that every sword in the empire would be
      drawn for his service. The military designs of that prince, who had formed
      three different attacks against Thrace, were prevented by this fortunate
      event. Without shedding the blood of his fellow-citizens, he escaped the
      dangers of a doubtful conflict, and acquired the advantages of a complete
      victory. Impatient to visit the place of his birth, and the new capital of
      the empire, he advanced from Naissus through the mountains of Haemus, and
      the cities of Thrace. When he reached Heraclea, at the distance of sixty
      miles, all Constantinople was poured forth to receive him; and he made his
      triumphal entry amidst the dutiful acclamations of the soldiers, the
      people, and the senate. At innumerable multitude pressed around him with
      eager respect and were perhaps disappointed when they beheld the small
      stature and simple garb of a hero, whose unexperienced youth had
      vanquished the Barbarians of Germany, and who had now traversed, in a
      successful career, the whole continent of Europe, from the shores of the
      Atlantic to those of the Bosphorus. <a href="#Blink22note-43" id="Blink22noteref-43" name="Blink22noteref-43">43</a> A few days
      afterwards, when the remains of the deceased emperor were landed in the
      harbor, the subjects of Julian applauded the real or affected humanity of
      their sovereign. On foot, without his diadem, and clothed in a mourning
      habit, he accompanied the funeral as far as the church of the Holy
      Apostles, where the body was deposited: and if these marks of respect may
      be interpreted as a selfish tribute to the birth and dignity of his
      Imperial kinsman, the tears of Julian professed to the world that he had
      forgot the injuries, and remembered only the obligations, which he had
      received from Constantius. <a href="#Blink22note-44" id="Blink22noteref-44" name="Blink22noteref-44">44</a> As soon as the legions of Aquileia were
      assured of the death of the emperor, they opened the gates of the city,
      and, by the sacrifice of their guilty leaders, obtained an easy pardon
      from the prudence or lenity of Julian; who, in the thirty-second year of
      his age, acquired the undisputed possession of the Roman empire. <a href="#Blink22note-45" id="Blink22noteref-45" name="Blink22noteref-45">45</a>

      Philosophy had instructed Julian to compare the advantages of action and
      retirement; but the elevation of his birth, and the accidents of his life,
      never allowed him the freedom of choice. He might perhaps sincerely have
      preferred the groves of the academy, and the society of Athens; but he was
      constrained, at first by the will, and afterwards by the injustice, of
      Constantius, to expose his person and fame to the dangers of Imperial
      greatness; and to make himself accountable to the world, and to posterity,
      for the happiness of millions. <a href="#Blink22note-46" id="Blink22noteref-46" name="Blink22noteref-46">46</a> Julian recollected
      with terror the observation of his master Plato, <a href="#Blink22note-47" id="Blink22noteref-47" name="Blink22noteref-47">47</a> that the government
      of our flocks and herds is always committed to beings of a superior
      species; and that the conduct of nations requires and deserves the
      celestial powers of the gods or of the genii. From this principle he
      justly concluded, that the man who presumes to reign, should aspire to the
      perfection of the divine nature; that he should purify his soul from her
      mortal and terrestrial part; that he should extinguish his appetites,
      enlighten his understanding, regulate his passions, and subdue the wild
      beast, which, according to the lively metaphor of Aristotle, <a href="#Blink22note-48" id="Blink22noteref-48" name="Blink22noteref-48">48</a>
      seldom fails to ascend the throne of a despot. The throne of Julian, which
      the death of Constantius fixed on an independent basis, was the seat of
      reason, of virtue, and perhaps of vanity. He despised the honors,
      renounced the pleasures, and discharged with incessant diligence the
      duties, of his exalted station; and there were few among his subjects who
      would have consented to relieve him from the weight of the diadem, had
      they been obliged to submit their time and their actions to the rigorous
      laws which that philosophic emperor imposed on himself. One of his most
      intimate friends, <a href="#Blink22note-49" id="Blink22noteref-49" name="Blink22noteref-49">49</a> who had often shared the frugal simplicity of
      his table, has remarked, that his light and sparing diet (which was
      usually of the vegetable kind) left his mind and body always free and
      active, for the various and important business of an author, a pontiff, a
      magistrate, a general, and a prince. In one and the same day, he gave
      audience to several ambassadors, and wrote, or dictated, a great number of
      letters to his generals, his civil magistrates, his private friends, and
      the different cities of his dominions. He listened to the memorials which
      had been received, considered the subject of the petitions, and signified
      his intentions more rapidly than they could be taken in short-hand by the
      diligence of his secretaries. He possessed such flexibility of thought,
      and such firmness of attention, that he could employ his hand to write,
      his ear to listen, and his voice to dictate; and pursue at once three
      several trains of ideas without hesitation, and without error. While his
      ministers reposed, the prince flew with agility from one labor to another,
      and, after a hasty dinner, retired into his library, till the public
      business, which he had appointed for the evening, summoned him to
      interrupt the prosecution of his studies. The supper of the emperor was
      still less substantial than the former meal; his sleep was never clouded
      by the fumes of indigestion; and except in the short interval of a
      marriage, which was the effect of policy rather than love, the chaste
      Julian never shared his bed with a female companion. <a href="#Blink22note-50" id="Blink22noteref-50" name="Blink22noteref-50">50</a>
      He was soon awakened by the entrance of fresh secretaries, who had slept
      the preceding day; and his servants were obliged to wait alternately while
      their indefatigable master allowed himself scarcely any other refreshment
      than the change of occupation. The predecessors of Julian, his uncle, his
      brother, and his cousin, indulged their puerile taste for the games of the
      Circus, under the specious pretence of complying with the inclinations of
      the people; and they frequently remained the greatest part of the day as
      idle spectators, and as a part of the splendid spectacle, till the
      ordinary round of twenty-four races <a href="#Blink22note-51" id="Blink22noteref-51" name="Blink22noteref-51">51</a> was completely
      finished. On solemn festivals, Julian, who felt and professed an
      unfashionable dislike to these frivolous amusements, condescended to
      appear in the Circus; and after bestowing a careless glance at five or six
      of the races, he hastily withdrew with the impatience of a philosopher,
      who considered every moment as lost that was not devoted to the advantage
      of the public or the improvement of his own mind. <a href="#Blink22note-52" id="Blink22noteref-52" name="Blink22noteref-52">52</a> By this avarice of
      time, he seemed to protract the short duration of his reign; and if the
      dates were less securely ascertained, we should refuse to believe, that
      only sixteen months elapsed between the death of Constantius and the
      departure of his successor for the Persian war. The actions of Julian can
      only be preserved by the care of the historian; but the portion of his
      voluminous writings, which is still extant, remains as a monument of the
      application, as well as of the genius, of the emperor. The Misopogon, the
      Caesars, several of his orations, and his elaborate work against the
      Christian religion, were composed in the long nights of the two winters,
      the former of which he passed at Constantinople, and the latter at
      Antioch.

      The reformation of the Imperial court was one of the first and most
      necessary acts of the government of Julian. <a href="#Blink22note-53" id="Blink22noteref-53" name="Blink22noteref-53">53</a> Soon after his
      entrance into the palace of Constantinople, he had occasion for the
      service of a barber. An officer, magnificently dressed, immediately
      presented himself. "It is a barber," exclaimed the prince, with affected
      surprise, "that I want, and not a receiver-general of the finances." <a href="#Blink22note-54" id="Blink22noteref-54" name="Blink22noteref-54">54</a>
      He questioned the man concerning the profits of his employment and was
      informed, that besides a large salary, and some valuable perquisites, he
      enjoyed a daily allowance for twenty servants, and as many horses. A
      thousand barbers, a thousand cup-bearers, a thousand cooks, were
      distributed in the several offices of luxury; and the number of eunuchs
      could be compared only with the insects of a summer's day. The monarch who
      resigned to his subjects the superiority of merit and virtue, was
      distinguished by the oppressive magnificence of his dress, his table, his
      buildings, and his train. The stately palaces erected by Constantine and
      his sons, were decorated with many colored marbles, and ornaments of massy
      gold. The most exquisite dainties were procured, to gratify their pride,
      rather than their taste; birds of the most distant climates, fish from the
      most remote seas, fruits out of their natural season, winter roses, and
      summer snows. <a href="#Blink22note-56" id="Blink22noteref-56" name="Blink22noteref-56">56</a> The domestic crowd of the palace surpassed
      the expense of the legions; yet the smallest part of this costly multitude
      was subservient to the use, or even to the splendor, of the throne. The
      monarch was disgraced, and the people was injured, by the creation and
      sale of an infinite number of obscure, and even titular employments; and
      the most worthless of mankind might purchase the privilege of being
      maintained, without the necessity of labor, from the public revenue. The
      waste of an enormous household, the increase of fees and perquisites,
      which were soon claimed as a lawful debt, and the bribes which they
      extorted from those who feared their enmity, or solicited their favor,
      suddenly enriched these haughty menials. They abused their fortune,
      without considering their past, or their future, condition; and their
      rapine and venality could be equalled only by the extravagance of their
      dissipations. Their silken robes were embroidered with gold, their tables
      were served with delicacy and profusion; the houses which they built for
      their own use, would have covered the farm of an ancient consul; and the
      most honorable citizens were obliged to dismount from their horses, and
      respectfully to salute a eunuch whom they met on the public highway. The
      luxury of the palace excited the contempt and indignation of Julian, who
      usually slept on the ground, who yielded with reluctance to the
      indispensable calls of nature; and who placed his vanity, not in
      emulating, but in despising, the pomp of royalty.

      By the total extirpation of a mischief which was magnified even beyond its

      murmurs of the people; who support with less uneasiness the weight of
      taxes, if they are convinced that the fruits of their industry are
      appropriated to the service of the state. But in the execution of this
      salutary work, Julian is accused of proceeding with too much haste and
      inconsiderate severity. By a single edict, he reduced the palace of
      Constantinople to an immense desert, and dismissed with ignominy the whole
      train of slaves and dependants, <a href="#Blink22note-57" id="Blink22noteref-57" name="Blink22noteref-57">57</a> without providing any
      just, or at least benevolent, exceptions, for the age, the services, or
      the poverty, of the faithful domestics of the Imperial family. Such indeed

      Aristotle, that true virtue is placed at an equal distance between the
      opposite vices.

      The splendid and effeminate dress of the Asiatics, the curls and paint,
      the collars and bracelets, which had appeared so ridiculous in the person

      But with the fopperies, Julian affected to renounce the decencies of
      dress; and seemed to value himself for his neglect of the laws of
      cleanliness. In a satirical performance, which was designed for the public
      eye, the emperor descants with pleasure, and even with pride, on the
      length of his nails, and the inky blackness of his hands; protests, that
      although the greatest part of his body was covered with hair, the use of
      the razor was confined to his head alone; and celebrates, with visible
      complacency, the shaggy and populous <a href="#Blink22note-58" id="Blink22noteref-58" name="Blink22noteref-58">58</a> beard, which he
      fondly cherished, after the example of the philosophers of Greece. Had

      of Darius.

      passage, so offensive to their delicacy, (Hist. de Jovien, tom. ii. p.

    </p>
<p>
      But the work of public reformation would have remained imperfect, if
      Julian had only corrected the abuses, without punishing the crimes, of his
      predecessor's reign. "We are now delivered," says he, in a familiar letter
      to one of his intimate friends, "we are now surprisingly delivered from
      the voracious jaws of the Hydra. <a href="#Blink22note-59" id="Blink22noteref-59" name="Blink22noteref-59">59</a> I do not mean to
      apply the epithet to my brother Constantius. He is no more; may the earth
      lie light on his head! But his artful and cruel favorites studied to
      deceive and exasperate a prince, whose natural mildness cannot be praised
      without some efforts of adulation. It is not, however, my intention, that
      even those men should be oppressed: they are accused, and they shall enjoy
      the benefit of a fair and impartial trial." To conduct this inquiry,
      Julian named six judges of the highest rank in the state and army; and as
      he wished to escape the reproach of condemning his personal enemies, he
      fixed this extraordinary tribunal at Chalcedon, on the Asiatic side of the
      Bosphorus; and transferred to the commissioners an absolute power to
      pronounce and execute their final sentence, without delay, and without
      appeal. The office of president was exercised by the venerable praefect of
      the East, a second Sallust, <a href="#Blink22note-60" id="Blink22noteref-60" name="Blink22noteref-60">60</a> whose virtues
      conciliated the esteem of Greek sophists, and of Christian bishops. He was

      own applause. But the civil wisdom of two magistrates was overbalanced by
      the ferocious violence of four generals, Nevitta, Agilo, Jovinus, and
      Arbetio. Arbetio, whom the public would have seen with less surprise at
      the bar than on the bench, was supposed to possess the secret of the
      commission; the armed and angry leaders of the Jovian and Herculian bands
      encompassed the tribunal; and the judges were alternately swayed by the
      laws of justice, and by the clamors of faction. <a href="#Blink22note-62" id="Blink22noteref-62" name="Blink22noteref-62">62</a>

<p>
      The chamberlain Eusebius, who had so long abused the favor of Constantius,
      expiated, by an ignominious death, the insolence, the corruption, and
      cruelty of his servile reign. The executions of Paul and Apodemius (the
      former of whom was burnt alive) were accepted as an inadequate atonement
      by the widows and orphans of so many hundred Romans, whom those legal
      tyrants had betrayed and murdered. But justice herself (if we may use the
      pathetic expression of Ammianus) <a href="#Blink22note-63" id="Blink22noteref-63" name="Blink22noteref-63">63</a> appeared to weep over
      the fate of Ursulus, the treasurer of the empire; and his blood accused
      the ingratitude of Julian, whose distress had been seasonably relieved by
      the intrepid liberality of that honest minister. The rage of the soldiers,
      whom he had provoked by his indiscretion, was the cause and the excuse of
      his death; and the emperor, deeply wounded by his own reproaches and those
      of the public, offered some consolation to the family of Ursulus, by the
      restitution of his confiscated fortunes. Before the end of the year in
      which they had been adorned with the ensigns of the prefecture and
      consulship, <a href="#Blink22note-64" id="Blink22noteref-64" name="Blink22noteref-64">64</a> Taurus and Florentius were reduced to implore
      the clemency of the inexorable tribunal of Chalcedon. The former was
      banished to Vercellae in Italy, and a sentence of death was pronounced
      against the latter. A wise prince should have rewarded the crime of
      Taurus: the faithful minister, when he was no longer able to oppose the
      progress of a rebel, had taken refuge in the court of his benefactor and
      his lawful sovereign. But the guilt of Florentius justified the severity
      of the judges; and his escape served to display the magnanimity of Julian,
      who nobly checked the interested diligence of an informer, and refused to
      learn what place concealed the wretched fugitive from his just resentment.
      <a href="#Blink22note-65" id="Blink22noteref-65" name="Blink22noteref-65">65</a>
      Some months after the tribunal of Chalcedon had been dissolved, the
      praetorian vicegerent of Africa, the notary Gaudentius, and Artemius <a href="#Blink22note-66" id="Blink22noteref-66" name="Blink22noteref-66">66</a>
      duke of Egypt, were executed at Antioch. Artemius had reigned the cruel
      and corrupt tyrant of a great province; Gaudentius had long practised the
      arts of calumny against the innocent, the virtuous, and even the person of
      Julian himself. Yet the circumstances of their trial and condemnation were
      so unskillfully managed, that these wicked men obtained, in the public
      opinion, the glory of suffering for the obstinate loyalty with which they
      had supported the cause of Constantius. The rest of his servants were
      protected by a general act of oblivion; and they were left to enjoy with
      impunity the bribes which they had accepted, either to defend the
      oppressed, or to oppress the friendless. This measure, which, on the
      soundest principles of policy, may deserve our approbation, was executed
      in a manner which seemed to degrade the majesty of the throne. Julian was
      tormented by the importunities of a multitude, particularly of Egyptians,
      who loudly redemanded the gifts which they had imprudently or illegally
      bestowed; he foresaw the endless prosecution of vexatious suits; and he
      engaged a promise, which ought always to have been sacred, that if they
      would repair to Chalcedon, he would meet them in person, to hear and
      determine their complaints. But as soon as they were landed, he issued an
      absolute order, which prohibited the watermen from transporting any
      Egyptian to Constantinople; and thus detained his disappointed clients on
      the Asiatic shore till, their patience and money being utterly exhausted,
      they were obliged to return with indignant murmurs to their native
      country. <a href="#Blink22note-67" id="Blink22noteref-67" name="Blink22noteref-67">67</a>

      The numerous army of spies, of agents, and informers enlisted by
      Constantius to secure the repose of one man, and to interrupt that of
      millions, was immediately disbanded by his generous successor. Julian was
      slow in his suspicions, and gentle in his punishments; and his contempt of
      treason was the result of judgment, of vanity, and of courage. Conscious
      of superior merit, he was persuaded that few among his subjects would dare
      to meet him in the field, to attempt his life, or even to seat themselves
      on his vacant throne. The philosopher could excuse the hasty sallies of
      discontent; and the hero could despise the ambitious projects which
      surpassed the fortune or the abilities of the rash conspirators. A citizen
      of Ancyra had prepared for his own use a purple garment; and this
      indiscreet action, which, under the reign of Constantius, would have been
      considered as a capital offence, <a href="#Blink22note-68" id="Blink22noteref-68" name="Blink22noteref-68">68</a> was reported to
      Julian by the officious importunity of a private enemy. The monarch, after
      making some inquiry into the rank and character of his rival, despatched
      the informer with a present of a pair of purple slippers, to complete the
      magnificence of his Imperial habit. A more dangerous conspiracy was formed
      by ten of the domestic guards, who had resolved to assassinate Julian in
      the field of exercise near Antioch. Their intemperance revealed their
      guilt; and they were conducted in chains to the presence of their injured
      sovereign, who, after a lively representation of the wickedness and folly
      of their enterprise, instead of a death of torture, which they deserved
      and expected, pronounced a sentence of exile against the two principal
      offenders. The only instance in which Julian seemed to depart from his
      accustomed clemency, was the execution of a rash youth, who, with a feeble
      hand, had aspired to seize the reins of empire. But that youth was the son
      of Marcellus, the general of cavalry, who, in the first campaign of the
      Gallic war, had deserted the standard of the Caesar and the republic.
      Without appearing to indulge his personal resentment, Julian might easily
      confound the crime of the son and of the father; but he was reconciled by
      the distress of Marcellus, and the liberality of the emperor endeavored to
      heal the wound which had been inflicted by the hand of justice. <a href="#Blink22note-69" id="Blink22noteref-69" name="Blink22noteref-69">69</a>

      Julian was not insensible of the advantages of freedom. <a href="#Blink22note-70" id="Blink22noteref-70" name="Blink22noteref-70">70</a>
      From his studies he had imbibed the spirit of ancient sages and heroes;
      his life and fortunes had depended on the caprice of a tyrant; and when he
      ascended the throne, his pride was sometimes mortified by the reflection,
      that the slaves who would not dare to censure his defects were not worthy
      to applaud his virtues. <a href="#Blink22note-71" id="Blink22noteref-71" name="Blink22noteref-71">71</a> He sincerely abhorred the system of Oriental
      despotism, which Diocletian, Constantine, and the patient habits of
      fourscore years, had established in the empire. A motive of superstition
      prevented the execution of the design, which Julian had frequently
      meditated, of relieving his head from the weight of a costly diadem; <a href="#Blink22note-72" id="Blink22noteref-72" name="Blink22noteref-72">72</a>
      but he absolutely refused the title of Dominus, or Lord, <a href="#Blink22note-73" id="Blink22noteref-73" name="Blink22noteref-73">73</a>
      a word which was grown so familiar to the ears of the Romans, that they no
      longer remembered its servile and humiliating origin. The office, or
      rather the name, of consul, was cherished by a prince who contemplated
      with reverence the ruins of the republic; and the same behavior which had
      been assumed by the prudence of Augustus was adopted by Julian from choice
      and inclination. On the calends of January, at break of day, the new
      consuls, Mamertinus and Nevitta, hastened to the palace to salute the
      emperor. As soon as he was informed of their approach, he leaped from his
      throne, eagerly advanced to meet them, and compelled the blushing
      magistrates to receive the demonstrations of his affected humility. From
      the palace they proceeded to the senate. The emperor, on foot, marched
      before their litters; and the gazing multitude admired the image of
      ancient times, or secretly blamed a conduct, which, in their eyes,
      degraded the majesty of the purple. <a href="#Blink22note-74" id="Blink22noteref-74" name="Blink22noteref-74">74</a> But the behavior of
      Julian was uniformly supported. During the games of the Circus, he had,
      imprudently or designedly, performed the manumission of a slave in the
      presence of the consul. The moment he was reminded that he had trespassed
      on the jurisdiction of another magistrate, he condemned himself to pay a
      fine of ten pounds of gold; and embraced this public occasion of declaring
      to the world, that he was subject, like the rest of his fellow-citizens,
      to the laws, <a href="#Blink22note-75" id="Blink22noteref-75" name="Blink22noteref-75">75</a> and even to the forms, of the republic. The
      spirit of his administration, and his regard for the place of his
      nativity, induced Julian to confer on the senate of Constantinople the
      same honors, privileges, and authority, which were still enjoyed by the
      senate of ancient Rome. <a href="#Blink22note-76" id="Blink22noteref-76" name="Blink22noteref-76">76</a> A legal fiction was introduced, and gradually
      established, that one half of the national council had migrated into the
      East; and the despotic successors of Julian, accepting the title of
      Senators, acknowledged themselves the members of a respectable body, which
      was permitted to represent the majesty of the Roman name. From
      Constantinople, the attention of the monarch was extended to the municipal
      senates of the provinces. He abolished, by repeated edicts, the unjust and
      pernicious exemptions which had withdrawn so many idle citizens from the
      services of their country; and by imposing an equal distribution of public
      duties, he restored the strength, the splendor, or, according to the
      glowing expression of Libanius, <a href="#Blink22note-77" id="Blink22noteref-77" name="Blink22noteref-77">77</a> the soul of the
      expiring cities of his empire. The venerable age of Greece excited the
      most tender compassion in the mind of Julian, which kindled into rapture
      when he recollected the gods, the heroes, and the men superior to heroes
      and to gods, who have bequeathed to the latest posterity the monuments of
      their genius, or the example of their virtues. He relieved the distress,
      and restored the beauty, of the cities of Epirus and Peloponnesus. <a href="#Blink22note-78" id="Blink22noteref-78" name="Blink22noteref-78">78</a>
      Athens acknowledged him for her benefactor; Argos, for her deliverer. The
      pride of Corinth, again rising from her ruins with the honors of a Roman
      colony, exacted a tribute from the adjacent republics, for the purpose of
      defraying the games of the Isthmus, which were celebrated in the
      amphitheatre with the hunting of bears and panthers. From this tribute the
      cities of Elis, of Delphi, and of Argos, which had inherited from their
      remote ancestors the sacred office of perpetuating the Olympic, the
      Pythian, and the Nemean games, claimed a just exemption. The immunity of
      Elis and Delphi was respected by the Corinthians; but the poverty of Argos
      tempted the insolence of oppression; and the feeble complaints of its
      deputies were silenced by the decree of a provincial magistrate, who seems
      to have consulted only the interest of the capital in which he resided.
      Seven years after this sentence, Julian <a href="#Blink22note-79" id="Blink22noteref-79" name="Blink22noteref-79">79</a> allowed the cause to
      be referred to a superior tribunal; and his eloquence was interposed, most
      probably with success, in the defence of a city, which had been the royal
      seat of Agamemnon, <a href="#Blink22note-80" id="Blink22noteref-80" name="Blink22noteref-80">80</a> and had given to Macedonia a race of kings

      republican, and the talents of a rhetorician. He alternately practised, as
      in a school of declamation, the several modes of praise, of censure, of
      exhortation; and his friend Libanius has remarked, that the study of Homer
      taught him to imitate the simple, concise style of Menelaus, the
      copiousness of Nestor, whose words descended like the flakes of a winter's
      snow, or the pathetic and forcible eloquence of Ulysses. The functions of
      a judge, which are sometimes incompatible with those of a prince, were
      exercised by Julian, not only as a duty, but as an amusement; and although
      he might have trusted the integrity and discernment of his Praetorian
      praefects, he often placed himself by their side on the seat of judgment.
      The acute penetration of his mind was agreeably occupied in detecting and
      defeating the chicanery of the advocates, who labored to disguise the
      truths of facts, and to pervert the sense of the laws. He sometimes forgot
      the gravity of his station, asked indiscreet or unseasonable questions,
      and betrayed, by the loudness of his voice, and the agitation of his body,
      the earnest vehemence with which he maintained his opinion against the
      judges, the advocates, and their clients. But his knowledge of his own
      temper prompted him to encourage, and even to solicit, the reproof of his
      friends and ministers; and whenever they ventured to oppose the irregular
      sallies of his passions, the spectators could observe the shame, as well
      as the gratitude, of their monarch. The decrees of Julian were almost
      always founded on the principles of justice; and he had the firmness to
      resist the two most dangerous temptations, which assault the tribunal of a
      sovereign, under the specious forms of compassion and equity. He decided
      the merits of the cause without weighing the circumstances of the parties;
      and the poor, whom he wished to relieve, were condemned to satisfy the
      just demands of a wealthy and noble adversary. He carefully distinguished
      the judge from the legislator; <a href="#Blink22note-84" id="Blink22noteref-84" name="Blink22noteref-84">84</a> and though he
      meditated a necessary reformation of the Roman jurisprudence, he
      pronounced sentence according to the strict and literal interpretation of
      those laws, which the magistrates were bound to execute, and the subjects
      to obey.

      harangued the senate. All the predecessors of Nero, (Tacit. Annal. xiii.

      public; and it might be proved by various examples, that they frequently
      exercised it in the senate.]

      duties, of the judge. Gregory Nazianzen, (Orat. iv. p. 120,) who
      suppresses the virtues, and exaggerates even the venial faults of the
      Apostate, triumphantly asks, whether such a judge was fit to be seated

      Julian enacted in a reign of sixteen months, fifty-four have been admitted
      into the codes of Theodosius and Justinian. (Gothofred. Chron. Legum, p.
      64-67.) The Abbe de la Bleterie (tom. ii. p. 329-336) has chosen one of
      these laws to give an idea of Julian's Latin style, which is forcible and
      elaborate, but less pure than his Greek.]

      The generality of princes, if they were stripped of their purple, and cast
      naked into the world, would immediately sink to the lowest rank of
      society, without a hope of emerging from their obscurity. But the personal
      merit of Julian was, in some measure, independent of his fortune. Whatever
      had been his choice of life, by the force of intrepid courage, lively wit,
      and intense application, he would have obtained, or at least he would have
      deserved, the highest honors of his profession; and Julian might have
      raised himself to the rank of minister, or general, of the state in which
      he was born a private citizen. If the jealous caprice of power had
      disappointed his expectations, if he had prudently declined the paths of
      greatness, the employment of the same talents in studious solitude would
      have placed beyond the reach of kings his present happiness and his
      immortal fame. When we inspect, with minute, or perhaps malevolent
      attention, the portrait of Julian, something seems wanting to the grace
      and perfection of the whole figure. His genius was less powerful and
      sublime than that of Caesar; nor did he possess the consummate prudence of
      Augustus. The virtues of Trajan appear more steady and natural, and the
      philosophy of Marcus is more simple and consistent. Yet Julian sustained
      adversity with firmness, and prosperity with moderation. After an interval
      of one hundred and twenty years from the death of Alexander Severus, the
      Romans beheld an emperor who made no distinction between his duties and
      his pleasures; who labored to relieve the distress, and to revive the
      spirit, of his subjects; and who endeavored always to connect authority
      with merit, and happiness with virtue. Even faction, and religious
      faction, was constrained to acknowledge the superiority of his genius, in
      peace as well as in war, and to confess, with a sigh, that the apostate
      Julian was a lover of his country, and that he deserved the empire of the
      world. <a href="#Blink22note-85" id="Blink22noteref-85" name="Blink22noteref-85">85</a>
