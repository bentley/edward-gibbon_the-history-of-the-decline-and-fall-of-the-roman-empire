<p>
      In the second year of the reign of Valentinian and Valens, on the morning
      of the twenty-first day of July, the greatest part of the Roman world was
      shaken by a violent and destructive earthquake. The impression was
      communicated to the waters; the shores of the Mediterranean were left dry,
      by the sudden retreat of the sea; great quantities of fish were caught
      with the hand; large vessels were stranded on the mud; and a curious
      spectator <a href="#Blink26note-1" id="Blink26noteref-1" name="Blink26noteref-1">1</a> amused his eye, or rather his fancy, by
      contemplating the various appearance of valleys and mountains, which had
      never, since the formation of the globe, been exposed to the sun. But the
      tide soon returned, with the weight of an immense and irresistible deluge,
      which was severely felt on the coasts of Sicily, of Dalmatia, of Greece,
      and of Egypt: large boats were transported, and lodged on the roofs of
      houses, or at the distance of two miles from the shore; the people, with
      their habitations, were swept away by the waters; and the city of
      Alexandria annually commemorated the fatal day, on which fifty thousand
      persons had lost their lives in the inundation. This calamity, the report
      of which was magnified from one province to another, astonished and
      terrified the subjects of Rome; and their affrighted imagination enlarged
      the real extent of a momentary evil. They recollected the preceding
      earthquakes, which had subverted the cities of Palestine and Bithynia:
      they considered these alarming strokes as the prelude only of still more
      dreadful calamities, and their fearful vanity was disposed to confound the
      symptoms of a declining empire and a sinking world. <a href="#Blink26note-2" id="Blink26noteref-2" name="Blink26noteref-2">2</a> It was the fashion of
      the times to attribute every remarkable event to the particular will of
      the Deity; the alterations of nature were connected, by an invisible
      chain, with the moral and metaphysical opinions of the human mind; and the
      most sagacious divines could distinguish, according to the color of their
      respective prejudices, that the establishment of heresy tended to produce
      an earthquake; or that a deluge was the inevitable consequence of the
      progress of sin and error. Without presuming to discuss the truth or
      propriety of these lofty speculations, the historian may content himself
      with an observation, which seems to be justified by experience, that man
      has much more to fear from the passions of his fellow-creatures, than from
      the convulsions of the elements. <a href="#Blink26note-3" id="Blink26noteref-3" name="Blink26noteref-3">3</a> The mischievous effects
      of an earthquake, or deluge, a hurricane, or the eruption of a volcano,
      bear a very inconsiderable portion to the ordinary calamities of war, as
      they are now moderated by the prudence or humanity of the princes of
      Europe, who amuse their own leisure, and exercise the courage of their
      subjects, in the practice of the military art. But the laws and manners of
      modern nations protect the safety and freedom of the vanquished soldier;
      and the peaceful citizen has seldom reason to complain, that his life, or
      even his fortune, is exposed to the rage of war. In the disastrous period
      of the fall of the Roman empire, which may justly be dated from the reign
      of Valens, the happiness and security of each individual were personally
      attacked; and the arts and labors of ages were rudely defaced by the
      Barbarians of Scythia and Germany. The invasion of the Huns precipitated
      on the provinces of the West the Gothic nation, which advanced, in less
      than forty years, from the Danube to the Atlantic, and opened a way, by
      the success of their arms, to the inroads of so many hostile tribes, more
      savage than themselves. The original principle of motion was concealed in
      the remote countries of the North; and the curious observation of the
      pastoral life of the Scythians, <a href="#Blink26note-4" id="Blink26noteref-4" name="Blink26noteref-4">4</a> or Tartars, <a href="#Blink26note-5" id="Blink26noteref-5" name="Blink26noteref-5">5</a>
      will illustrate the latent cause of these destructive emigrations.

      were a primitive tribe, the rivals, and at length the subjects, of the
      Moguls. In the victorious armies of Zingis Khan, and his successors, the
      Tartars formed the vanguard; and the name, which first reached the ears of
      foreigners, was applied to the whole nation, (Freret, in the Hist. de
      l'Academie, tom. xviii. p. 60.) In speaking of all, or any of the northern
      shepherds of Europe, or Asia, I indifferently use the appellations of
      Scythians or Tartars. * Note: The Moguls, (Mongols,) according to M.

      The different characters that mark the civilized nations of the globe, may
      be ascribed to the use, and the abuse, of reason; which so variously
      shapes, and so artificially composes, the manners and opinions of a
      European, or a Chinese. But the operation of instinct is more sure and
      simple than that of reason: it is much easier to ascertain the appetites
      of a quadruped than the speculations of a philosopher; and the savage
      tribes of mankind, as they approach nearer to the condition of animals,
      preserve a stronger resemblance to themselves and to each other. The
      uniform stability of their manners is the natural consequence of the
      imperfection of their faculties. Reduced to a similar situation, their
      wants, their desires, their enjoyments, still continue the same: and the
      influence of food or climate, which, in a more improved state of society,
      is suspended, or subdued, by so many moral causes, most powerfully
      contributes to form, and to maintain, the national character of
      Barbarians. In every age, the immense plains of Scythia, or Tartary, have
      been inhabited by vagrant tribes of hunters and shepherds, whose indolence
      refuses to cultivate the earth, and whose restless spirit disdains the
      confinement of a sedentary life. In every age, the Scythians, and Tartars,
      have been renowned for their invincible courage and rapid conquests. The
      thrones of Asia have been repeatedly overturned by the shepherds of the
      North; and their arms have spread terror and devastation over the most
      fertile and warlike countries of Europe. <a href="#Blink26note-6" id="Blink26noteref-6" name="Blink26noteref-6">6</a> On this occasion, as
      well as on many others, the sober historian is forcibly awakened from a
      pleasing vision; and is compelled, with some reluctance, to confess, that
      the pastoral manners, which have been adorned with the fairest attributes
      of peace and innocence, are much better adapted to the fierce and cruel
      habits of a military life. To illustrate this observation, I shall now
      proceed to consider a nation of shepherds and of warriors, in the three
      important articles of, I. Their diet; II. Their habitations; and, III.
      Their exercises. The narratives of antiquity are justified by the
      experience of modern times; <a href="#Blink26note-7" id="Blink26noteref-7" name="Blink26noteref-7">7</a> and the banks of the Borysthenes, of the Volga,
      or of the Selinga, will indifferently present the same uniform spectacle
      of similar and native manners. <a href="#Blink26note-8" id="Blink26noteref-8" name="Blink26noteref-8">8</a>

      I. The corn, or even the rice, which constitutes the ordinary and
      wholesome food of a civilized people, can be obtained only by the patient
      toil of the husbandman. Some of the happy savages, who dwell between the
      tropics, are plentifully nourished by the liberality of nature; but in the
      climates of the North, a nation of shepherds is reduced to their flocks
      and herds. The skilful practitioners of the medical art will determine (if
      they are able to determine) how far the temper of the human mind may be
      affected by the use of animal, or of vegetable, food; and whether the
      common association of carniverous and cruel deserves to be considered in
      any other light than that of an innocent, perhaps a salutary, prejudice of
      humanity. <a href="#Blink26note-9" id="Blink26noteref-9" name="Blink26noteref-9">9</a> Yet, if it be true, that the sentiment of
      compassion is imperceptibly weakened by the sight and practice of domestic
      cruelty, we may observe, that the horrid objects which are disguised by
      the arts of European refinement, are exhibited in their naked and most
      disgusting simplicity in the tent of a Tartarian shepherd. The ox, or the
      sheep, are slaughtered by the same hand from which they were accustomed to
      receive their daily food; and the bleeding limbs are served, with very
      little preparation, on the table of their unfeeling murderer. In the
      military profession, and especially in the conduct of a numerous army, the
      exclusive use of animal food appears to be productive of the most solid
      advantages. Corn is a bulky and perishable commodity; and the large
      magazines, which are indispensably necessary for the subsistence of our
      troops, must be slowly transported by the labor of men or horses. But the
      flocks and herds, which accompany the march of the Tartars, afford a sure
      and increasing supply of flesh and milk: in the far greater part of the
      uncultivated waste, the vegetation of the grass is quick and luxuriant;
      and there are few places so extremely barren, that the hardy cattle of the
      North cannot find some tolerable pasture.
    </p>
<p>
      The supply is multiplied and prolonged by the undistinguishing appetite,
      and patient abstinence, of the Tartars. They indifferently feed on the
      flesh of those animals that have been killed for the table, or have died
      of disease. Horseflesh, which in every age and country has been proscribed
      by the civilized nations of Europe and Asia, they devour with peculiar
      greediness; and this singular taste facilitates the success of their
      military operations. The active cavalry of Scythia is always followed, in
      their most distant and rapid incursions, by an adequate number of spare
      horses, who may be occasionally used, either to redouble the speed, or to
      satisfy the hunger, of the Barbarians. Many are the resources of courage
      and poverty. When the forage round a camp of Tartars is almost consumed,
      they slaughter the greatest part of their cattle, and preserve the flesh,
      either smoked, or dried in the sun. On the sudden emergency of a hasty
      march, they provide themselves with a sufficient quantity of little balls
      of cheese, or rather of hard curd, which they occasionally dissolve in
      water; and this unsubstantial diet will support, for many days, the life,
      and even the spirits, of the patient warrior. But this extraordinary
      abstinence, which the Stoic would approve, and the hermit might envy, is
      commonly succeeded by the most voracious indulgence of appetite. The wines
      of a happier climate are the most grateful present, or the most valuable
      commodity, that can be offered to the Tartars; and the only example of
      their industry seems to consist in the art of extracting from mare's milk
      a fermented liquor, which possesses a very strong power of intoxication.
      Like the animals of prey, the savages, both of the old and new world,
      experience the alternate vicissitudes of famine and plenty; and their
      stomach is inured to sustain, without much inconvenience, the opposite
      extremes of hunger and of intemperance.

      exciting our sensibility.]

<p>
      II. In the ages of rustic and martial simplicity, a people of soldiers and
      husbandmen are dispersed over the face of an extensive and cultivated
      country; and some time must elapse before the warlike youth of Greece or
      Italy could be assembled under the same standard, either to defend their
      own confines, or to invade the territories of the adjacent tribes. The
      progress of manufactures and commerce insensibly collects a large
      multitude within the walls of a city: but these citizens are no longer
      soldiers; and the arts which adorn and improve the state of civil society,
      corrupt the habits of the military life. The pastoral manners of the
      Scythians seem to unite the different advantages of simplicity and
      refinement. The individuals of the same tribe are constantly assembled,
      but they are assembled in a camp; and the native spirit of these dauntless
      shepherds is animated by mutual support and emulation. The houses of the
      Tartars are no more than small tents, of an oval form, which afford a cold
      and dirty habitation, for the promiscuous youth of both sexes. The palaces
      of the rich consist of wooden huts, of such a size that they may be
      conveniently fixed on large wagons, and drawn by a team perhaps of twenty
      or thirty oxen. The flocks and herds, after grazing all day in the
      adjacent pastures, retire, on the approach of night, within the protection
      of the camp. The necessity of preventing the most mischievous confusion,
      in such a perpetual concourse of men and animals, must gradually
      introduce, in the distribution, the order, and the guard, of the
      encampment, the rudiments of the military art. As soon as the forage of a
      certain district is consumed, the tribe, or rather army, of shepherds,
      makes a regular march to some fresh pastures; and thus acquires, in the
      ordinary occupations of the pastoral life, the practical knowledge of one
      of the most important and difficult operations of war. The choice of
      stations is regulated by the difference of the seasons: in the summer, the
      Tartars advance towards the North, and pitch their tents on the banks of a
      river, or, at least, in the neighborhood of a running stream. But in the
      winter, they return to the South, and shelter their camp, behind some
      convenient eminence, against the winds, which are chilled in their passage
      over the bleak and icy regions of Siberia. These manners are admirably
      adapted to diffuse, among the wandering tribes, the spirit of emigration
      and conquest. The connection between the people and their territory is of
      so frail a texture, that it may be broken by the slightest accident. The
      camp, and not the soil, is the native country of the genuine Tartar.
      Within the precincts of that camp, his family, his companions, his
      property, are always included; and, in the most distant marches, he is
      still surrounded by the objects which are dear, or valuable, or familiar
      in his eyes. The thirst of rapine, the fear, or the resentment of injury,
      the impatience of servitude, have, in every age, been sufficient causes to
      urge the tribes of Scythia boldly to advance into some unknown countries,
      where they might hope to find a more plentiful subsistence or a less
      formidable enemy. The revolutions of the North have frequently determined
      the fate of the South; and in the conflict of hostile nations, the victor
      and the vanquished have alternately drove, and been driven, from the
      confines of China to those of Germany. <a href="#Blink26note-10" id="Blink26noteref-10" name="Blink26noteref-10">10</a> These great
      emigrations, which have been sometimes executed with almost incredible
      diligence, were rendered more easy by the peculiar nature of the climate.
      It is well known that the cold of Tartary is much more severe than in the
      midst of the temperate zone might reasonably be expected; this uncommon
      rigor is attributed to the height of the plains, which rise, especially
      towards the East, more than half a mile above the level of the sea; and to
      the quantity of saltpetre with which the soil is deeply impregnated. <a href="#Blink26note-11" id="Blink26noteref-11" name="Blink26noteref-11">11</a>
      In the winter season, the broad and rapid rivers, that discharge their
      waters into the Euxine, the Caspian, or the Icy Sea, are strongly frozen;
      the fields are covered with a bed of snow; and the fugitive, or
      victorious, tribes may securely traverse, with their families, their
      wagons, and their cattle, the smooth and hard surface of an immense plain.

      deduces the revolutions of Asia from this important circumstance, that
      heat and cold, weakness and strength, touch each other without any

    </p>

      III. The pastoral life, compared with the labors of agriculture and
      manufactures, is undoubtedly a life of idleness; and as the most honorable
      shepherds of the Tartar race devolve on their captives the domestic
      management of the cattle, their own leisure is seldom disturbed by any
      servile and assiduous cares. But this leisure, instead of being devoted to
      the soft enjoyments of love and harmony, is use fully spent in the violent
      and sanguinary exercise of the chase. The plains of Tartary are filled
      with a strong and serviceable breed of horses, which are easily trained
      for the purposes of war and hunting. The Scythians of every age have been
      celebrated as bold and skilful riders; and constant practice had seated
      them so firmly on horseback, that they were supposed by strangers to
      perform the ordinary duties of civil life, to eat, to drink, and even to
      sleep, without dismounting from their steeds. They excel in the dexterous
      management of the lance; the long Tartar bow is drawn with a nervous arm;
      and the weighty arrow is directed to its object with unerring aim and
      irresistible force. These arrows are often pointed against the harmless
      animals of the desert, which increase and multiply in the absence of their
      most formidable enemy; the hare, the goat, the roebuck, the fallow-deer,
      the stag, the elk, and the antelope. The vigor and patience, both of the
      men and horses, are continually exercised by the fatigues of the chase;
      and the plentiful supply of game contributes to the subsistence, and even
      luxury, of a Tartar camp. But the exploits of the hunters of Scythia are
      not confined to the destruction of timid or innoxious beasts; they boldly
      encounter the angry wild boar, when he turns against his pursuers, excite
      the sluggish courage of the bear, and provoke the fury of the tiger, as he
      slumbers in the thicket. Where there is danger, there may be glory; and
      the mode of hunting, which opens the fairest field to the exertions of
      valor, may justly be considered as the image, and as the school, of war.
      The general hunting matches, the pride and delight of the Tartar princes,
      compose an instructive exercise for their numerous cavalry. A circle is
      drawn, of many miles in circumference, to encompass the game of an
      extensive district; and the troops that form the circle regularly advance
      towards a common centre; where the captive animals, surrounded on every
      side, are abandoned to the darts of the hunters. In this march, which
      frequently continues many days, the cavalry are obliged to climb the
      hills, to swim the rivers, and to wind through the valleys, without
      interrupting the prescribed order of their gradual progress. They acquire
      the habit of directing their eye, and their steps, to a remote object; of
      preserving their intervals of suspending or accelerating their pace,
      according to the motions of the troops on their right and left; and of
      watching and repeating the signals of their leaders. Their leaders study,
      in this practical school, the most important lesson of the military art;
      the prompt and accurate judgment of ground, of distance, and of time. To
      employ against a human enemy the same patience and valor, the same skill
      and discipline, is the only alteration which is required in real war; and
      the amusements of the chase serve as a prelude to the conquest of an
      empire. <a href="#Blink26note-12" id="Blink26noteref-12" name="Blink26noteref-12">12</a>

<p>
      The political society of the ancient Germans has the appearance of a
      voluntary alliance of independent warriors. The tribes of Scythia,
      distinguished by the modern appellation of Hords, assume the form of a
      numerous and increasing family; which, in the course of successive
      generations, has been propagated from the same original stock. The
      meanest, and most ignorant, of the Tartars, preserve, with conscious
      pride, the inestimable treasure of their genealogy; and whatever
      distinctions of rank may have been introduced, by the unequal distribution
      of pastoral wealth, they mutually respect themselves, and each other, as
      the descendants of the first founder of the tribe. The custom, which still
      prevails, of adopting the bravest and most faithful of the captives, may
      countenance the very probable suspicion, that this extensive consanguinity
      is, in a great measure, legal and fictitious. But the useful prejudice,
      which has obtained the sanction of time and opinion, produces the effects
      of truth; the haughty Barbarians yield a cheerful and voluntary obedience
      to the head of their blood; and their chief, or mursa, as the
      representative of their great father, exercises the authority of a judge
      in peace, and of a leader in war. In the original state of the pastoral
      world, each of the mursas (if we may continue to use a modern appellation)
      acted as the independent chief of a large and separate family; and the
      limits of their peculiar territories were gradually fixed by superior
      force, or mutual consent. But the constant operation of various and
      permanent causes contributed to unite the vagrant Hords into national
      communities, under the command of a supreme head. The weak were desirous
      of support, and the strong were ambitious of dominion; the power, which is
      the result of union, oppressed and collected the divided force of the
      adjacent tribes; and, as the vanquished were freely admitted to share the
      advantages of victory, the most valiant chiefs hastened to range
      themselves and their followers under the formidable standard of a
      confederate nation. The most successful of the Tartar princes assumed the
      military command, to which he was entitled by the superiority, either of
      merit or of power. He was raised to the throne by the acclamations of his
      equals; and the title of Khan expresses, in the language of the North of
      Asia, the full extent of the regal dignity. The right of hereditary
      succession was long confined to the blood of the founder of the monarchy;
      and at this moment all the Khans, who reign from Crimea to the wall of
      China, are the lineal descendants of the renowned Zingis. <a href="#Blink26note-13" id="Blink26noteref-13" name="Blink26noteref-13">13</a>
      But, as it is the indispensable duty of a Tartar sovereign to lead his
      warlike subjects into the field, the claims of an infant are often
      disregarded; and some royal kinsman, distinguished by his age and valor,
      is intrusted with the sword and sceptre of his predecessor. Two distinct
      and regular taxes are levied on the tribes, to support the dignity of the
      national monarch, and of their peculiar chief; and each of those
      contributions amounts to the tithe, both of their property, and of their
      spoil. A Tartar sovereign enjoys the tenth part of the wealth of his
      people; and as his own domestic riches of flocks and herds increase in a
      much larger proportion, he is able plentifully to maintain the rustic
      splendor of his court, to reward the most deserving, or the most favored
      of his followers, and to obtain, from the gentle influence of corruption,
      the obedience which might be sometimes refused to the stern mandates of
      authority. The manners of his subjects, accustomed, like himself, to blood
      and rapine, might excuse, in their eyes, such partial acts of tyranny, as
      would excite the horror of a civilized people; but the power of a despot
      has never been acknowledged in the deserts of Scythia. The immediate
      jurisdiction of the khan is confined within the limits of his own tribe;
      and the exercise of his royal prerogative has been moderated by the
      ancient institution of a national council. The Coroulai, <a href="#Blink26note-14" id="Blink26noteref-14" name="Blink26noteref-14">14</a>
      or Diet, of the Tartars, was regularly held in the spring and autumn, in
      the midst of a plain; where the princes of the reigning family, and the
      mursas of the respective tribes, may conveniently assemble on horseback,
      with their martial and numerous trains; and the ambitious monarch, who
      reviewed the strength, must consult the inclination of an armed people.
      The rudiments of a feudal government may be discovered in the constitution
      of the Scythian or Tartar nations; but the perpetual conflict of those
      hostile nations has sometimes terminated in the establishment of a
      powerful and despotic empire. The victor, enriched by the tribute, and
      fortified by the arms of dependent kings, has spread his conquests over
      Europe or Asia: the successful shepherds of the North have submitted to
      the confinement of arts, of laws, and of cities; and the introduction of
      luxury, after destroying the freedom of the people, has undermined the
      foundations of the throne. <a href="#Blink26note-15" id="Blink26noteref-15" name="Blink26noteref-15">15</a>

      The memory of past events cannot long be preserved in the frequent and
      remote emigrations of illiterate Barbarians. The modern Tartars are
      ignorant of the conquests of their ancestors; <a href="#Blink26note-16" id="Blink26noteref-16" name="Blink26noteref-16">16</a> and our knowledge of
      the history of the Scythians is derived from their intercourse with the
      learned and civilized nations of the South, the Greeks, the Persians, and
      the Chinese. The Greeks, who navigated the Euxine, and planted their
      colonies along the sea-coast, made the gradual and imperfect discovery of
      Scythia; from the Danube, and the confines of Thrace, as far as the frozen
      Maeotis, the seat of eternal winter, and Mount Caucasus, which, in the
      language of poetry, was described as the utmost boundary of the earth.
      They celebrated, with simple credulity, the virtues of the pastoral life:
      <a href="#Blink26note-17" id="Blink26noteref-17" name="Blink26noteref-17">17</a>
      they entertained a more rational apprehension of the strength and numbers
      of the warlike Barbarians, <a href="#Blink26note-18" id="Blink26noteref-18" name="Blink26noteref-18">18</a> who contemptuously baffled the immense
      armament of Darius, the son of Hystaspes. <a href="#Blink26note-19" id="Blink26noteref-19" name="Blink26noteref-19">19</a> The Persian monarchs
      had extended their western conquests to the banks of the Danube, and the
      limits of European Scythia. The eastern provinces of their empire were
      exposed to the Scythians of Asia; the wild inhabitants of the plains
      beyond the Oxus and the Jaxartes, two mighty rivers, which direct their
      course towards the Caspian Sea. The long and memorable quarrel of Iran and
      Touran is still the theme of history or romance: the famous, perhaps the
      fabulous, valor of the Persian heroes, Rustan and Asfendiar, was
      signalized, in the defence of their country, against the Afrasiabs of the
      North; <a href="#Blink26note-20" id="Blink26noteref-20" name="Blink26noteref-20">20</a> and the invincible spirit of the same
      Barbarians resisted, on the same ground, the victorious arms of Cyrus and
      Alexander. <a href="#Blink26note-21" id="Blink26noteref-21" name="Blink26noteref-21">21</a> In the eyes of the Greeks and Persians, the
      real geography of Scythia was bounded, on the East, by the mountains of
      Imaus, or Caf; and their distant prospect of the extreme and inaccessible
      parts of Asia was clouded by ignorance, or perplexed by fiction. But those
      inaccessible regions are the ancient residence of a powerful and civilized
      nation, <a href="#Blink26note-22" id="Blink26noteref-22" name="Blink26noteref-22">22</a> which ascends, by a probable tradition, above
      forty centuries; <a href="#Blink26note-23" id="Blink26noteref-23" name="Blink26noteref-23">23</a> and which is able to verify a series of near
      two thousand years, by the perpetual testimony of accurate and
      contemporary historians. <a href="#Blink26note-24" id="Blink26noteref-24" name="Blink26noteref-24">24</a> The annals of China <a href="#Blink26note-25" id="Blink26noteref-25" name="Blink26noteref-25">25</a> illustrate the state
      and revolutions of the pastoral tribes, which may still be distinguished
      by the vague appellation of Scythians, or Tartars; the vassals, the
      enemies, and sometimes the conquerors, of a great empire; whose policy has
      uniformly opposed the blind and impetuous valor of the Barbarians of the
      North. From the mouth of the Danube to the Sea of Japan, the whole
      longitude of Scythia is about one hundred and ten degrees, which, in that
      parallel, are equal to more than five thousand miles. The latitude of
      these extensive deserts cannot be so easily, or so accurately, measured;
      but, from the fortieth degree, which touches the wall of China, we may
      securely advance above a thousand miles to the northward, till our
      progress is stopped by the excessive cold of Siberia. In that dreary
      climate, instead of the animated picture of a Tartar camp, the smoke that
      issues from the earth, or rather from the snow, betrays the subterraneous
      dwellings of the Tongouses, and the Samoides: the want of horses and oxen
      is imperfectly supplied by the use of reindeer, and of large dogs; and the
      conquerors of the earth insensibly degenerate into a race of deformed and
      diminutive savages, who tremble at the sound of arms. <a href="#Blink26note-26" id="Blink26noteref-26" name="Blink26noteref-26">26</a>

      The Huns, who under the reign of Valens threatened the empire of Rome, had
      been formidable, in a much earlier period, to the empire of China. <a href="#Blink26note-27" id="Blink26noteref-27" name="Blink26noteref-27">27</a>
      Their ancient, perhaps their original, seat was an extensive, though dry
      and barren, tract of country, immediately on the north side of the great
      wall. Their place is at present occupied by the forty-nine Hords or
      Banners of the Mongous, a pastoral nation, which consists of about two
      hundred thousand families. <a href="#Blink26note-28" id="Blink26noteref-28" name="Blink26noteref-28">28</a> But the valor of the Huns had extended the
      narrow limits of their dominions; and their rustic chiefs, who assumed the
      appellation of Tanjou, gradually became the conquerors, and the sovereigns
      of a formidable empire. Towards the East, their victorious arms were
      stopped only by the ocean; and the tribes, which are thinly scattered
      between the Amoor and the extreme peninsula of Corea, adhered, with
      reluctance, to the standard of the Huns. On the West, near the head of the
      Irtish, in the valleys of Imaus, they found a more ample space, and more
      numerous enemies. One of the lieutenants of the Tanjou subdued, in a
      single expedition, twenty-six nations; the Igours, <a href="#Blink26note-29" id="Blink26noteref-29" name="Blink26noteref-29">29</a> distinguished above
      the Tartar race by the use of letters, were in the number of his vassals;
      and, by the strange connection of human events, the flight of one of those
      vagrant tribes recalled the victorious Parthians from the invasion of
      Syria. <a href="#Blink26note-30" id="Blink26noteref-30" name="Blink26noteref-30">30</a> On the side of the North, the ocean was
      assigned as the limit of the power of the Huns. Without enemies to resist
      their progress, or witnesses to contradict their vanity, they might
      securely achieve a real, or imaginary, conquest of the frozen regions of
      Siberia. The Northren Sea was fixed as the remote boundary of their
      empire. But the name of that sea, on whose shores the patriot Sovou
      embraced the life of a shepherd and an exile, <a href="#Blink26note-31" id="Blink26noteref-31" name="Blink26noteref-31">31</a> may be transferred,

      <a href="#Blink26note-32" id="Blink26noteref-32" name="Blink26noteref-32">32</a>
      and which actually communicates with the seas of the North, by the long
      course of the Angara, the Tongusha, and the Jenissea. The submission of so
      many distant nations might flatter the pride of the Tanjou; but the valor
      of the Huns could be rewarded only by the enjoyment of the wealth and
      luxury of the empire of the South. In the third century <a href="#Blink26note-3211" id="Blink26noteref-3211" name="Blink26noteref-3211">3211</a>
      before the Christian aera, a wall of fifteen hundred miles in length was
      constructed, to defend the frontiers of China against the inroads of the
      Huns; <a href="#Blink26note-33" id="Blink26noteref-33" name="Blink26noteref-33">33</a> but this stupendous work, which holds a
      conspicuous place in the map of the world, has never contributed to the
      safety of an unwarlike people. The cavalry of the Tanjou frequently
      consisted of two or three hundred thousand men, formidable by the
      matchless dexterity with which they managed their bows and their horses:
      by their hardy patience in supporting the inclemency of the weather; and
      by the incredible speed of their march, which was seldom checked by
      torrents, or precipices, by the deepest rivers, or by the most lofty
      mountains. They spread themselves at once over the face of the country;
      and their rapid impetuosity surprised, astonished, and disconcerted the
      grave and elaborate tactics of a Chinese army. The emperor Kaoti, <a href="#Blink26note-34" id="Blink26noteref-34" name="Blink26noteref-34">34</a>
      a soldier of fortune, whose personal merit had raised him to the throne,
      marched against the Huns with those veteran troops which had been trained
      in the civil wars of China. But he was soon surrounded by the Barbarians;
      and, after a siege of seven days, the monarch, hopeless of relief, was
      reduced to purchase his deliverance by an ignominious capitulation. The
      successors of Kaoti, whose lives were dedicated to the arts of peace, or
      the luxury of the palace, submitted to a more permanent disgrace. They too
      hastily confessed the insufficiency of arms and fortifications. They were
      too easily convinced, that while the blazing signals announced on every
      side the approach of the Huns, the Chinese troops, who slept with the
      helmet on their head, and the cuirass on their back, were destroyed by the
      incessant labor of ineffectual marches. <a href="#Blink26note-35" id="Blink26noteref-35" name="Blink26noteref-35">35</a> A regular payment of
      money, and silk, was stipulated as the condition of a temporary and
      precarious peace; and the wretched expedient of disguising a real tribute,
      under the names of a gift or subsidy, was practised by the emperors of
      China as well as by those of Rome. But there still remained a more
      disgraceful article of tribute, which violated the sacred feelings of
      humanity and nature. The hardships of the savage life, which destroy in
      their infancy the children who are born with a less healthy and robust
      constitution, introduced a remarkable disproportion between the numbers of
      the two sexes. The Tartars are an ugly and even deformed race; and while
      they consider their own women as the instruments of domestic labor, their
      desires, or rather their appetites, are directed to the enjoyment of more
      elegant beauty. A select band of the fairest maidens of China was annually
      devoted to the rude embraces of the Huns; <a href="#Blink26note-36" id="Blink26noteref-36" name="Blink26noteref-36">36</a> and the alliance of
      the haughty Tanjous was secured by their marriage with the genuine, or
      adopted, daughters of the Imperial family, which vainly attempted to
      escape the sacrilegious pollution. The situation of these unhappy victims
      is described in the verses of a Chinese princess, who laments that she had
      been condemned by her parents to a distant exile, under a Barbarian
      husband; who complains that sour milk was her only drink, raw flesh her
      only food, a tent her only palace; and who expresses, in a strain of
      pathetic simplicity, the natural wish, that she were transformed into a
      bird, to fly back to her dear country; the object of her tender and
      perpetual regret. <a href="#Blink26note-37" id="Blink26noteref-37" name="Blink26noteref-37">37</a>

      27 (<a href="#Blink26noteref-27">return</a>)<br/> [ M. de Guignes (tom. ii.
      p. 1—124) has given the original history of the ancient Hiong-nou,
      or Huns. The Chinese geography of their country (tom. i. part. p. lv.—lxiii.)
      seems to comprise a part of their conquests. * Note: The theory of De
      Guignes on the early history of the Huns is, in general, rejected by
      modern writers. De Guignes advanced no valid proof of the identity of the
      Hioung-nou of the Chinese writers with the Huns, except the similarity of
      name. Schlozer, (Allgemeine Nordische Geschichte, p. 252,) Klaproth,
      (Tableaux Historiques de l'Asie, p. 246,) St. Martin, iv. 61, and A.
      Remusat, (Recherches sur les Langues Tartares, D. P. xlvi, and p. 328;
      though in the latter passage he considers the theory of De Guignes not
      absolutely disproved,) concur in considering the Huns as belonging to the
      Finnish stock, distinct from the Moguls the Mandscheus, and the Turks. The
      Hiong-nou, according to Klaproth, were Turks. The names of the Hunnish
      chiefs could not be pronounced by a Turk; and, according to the same
      author, the Hioung-nou, which is explained in Chinese as detestable
      slaves, as early as the year 91 J. C., were dispersed by the Chinese, and
      assumed the name of Yue-po or Yue-pan. M. St. Martin does not consider it
      impossible that the appellation of Hioung-nou may have belonged to the
      Huns. But all agree in considering the Madjar or Magyar of modern Hungary
      the descendants of the Huns. Their language (compare Gibbon, c. lv. n. 22)
      is nearly related to the Lapponian and Vogoul. The noble forms of the
      modern Hungarians, so strongly contrasted with the hideous pictures which
      the fears and the hatred of the Romans give of the Huns, M. Klaproth
      accounts for by the intermingling with other races, Turkish and Slavonian.
      The present state of the question is thus stated in the last edition of
      Malte Brun, and a new and ingenious hypothesis suggested to resolve all
      the difficulties of the question. Were the Huns Finns? This obscure
      question has not been debated till very recently, and is yet very far from
      being decided. We are of opinion that it will be so hereafter in the same
      manner as that with regard to the Scythians. We shall trace in the
      portrait of Attila a dominant tribe or Mongols, or Kalmucks, with all the
      hereditary ugliness of that race; but in the mass of the Hunnish army and
      nation will be recognized the Chuni and the Ounni of the Greek Geography.
      the Kuns of the Hungarians, the European Huns, and a race in close
      relationship with the Flemish stock. Malte Brun, vi. p. 94. This theory is
      more fully and ably developed, p. 743. Whoever has seen the emperor of
      Austria's Hungarian guard, will not readily admit their descent from the
      Huns described by Sidonius Appolinaris.—M]

<p>
      The conquest of China has been twice achieved by the pastoral tribes of
      the North: the forces of the Huns were not inferior to those of the
      Moguls, or of the Mantcheoux; and their ambition might entertain the most
      sanguine hopes of success. But their pride was humbled, and their progress
      was checked, by the arms and policy of Vouti, <a href="#Blink26note-38" id="Blink26noteref-38" name="Blink26noteref-38">38</a> the fifth emperor of
      the powerful dynasty of the Han. In his long reign of fifty- four years,
      the Barbarians of the southern provinces submitted to the laws and manners
      of China; and the ancient limits of the monarchy were enlarged, from the
      great river of Kiang, to the port of Canton. Instead of confining himself
      to the timid operations of a defensive war, his lieutenants penetrated
      many hundred miles into the country of the Huns. In those boundless
      deserts, where it is impossible to form magazines, and difficult to
      transport a sufficient supply of provisions, the armies of Vouti were
      repeatedly exposed to intolerable hardships: and, of one hundred and forty
      thousand soldiers, who marched against the Barbarians, thirty thousand
      only returned in safety to the feet of their master. These losses,
      however, were compensated by splendid and decisive success. The Chinese
      generals improved the superiority which they derived from the temper of
      their arms, their chariots of war, and the service of their Tartar
      auxiliaries. The camp of the Tanjou was surprised in the midst of sleep
      and intemperance; and, though the monarch of the Huns bravely cut his way
      through the ranks of the enemy, he left above fifteen thousand of his
      subjects on the field of battle. Yet this signal victory, which was
      preceded and followed by many bloody engagements, contributed much less to
      the destruction of the power of the Huns than the effectual policy which
      was employed to detach the tributary nations from their obedience.
      Intimidated by the arms, or allured by the promises, of Vouti and his
      successors, the most considerable tribes, both of the East and of the
      West, disclaimed the authority of the Tanjou. While some acknowledged
      themselves the allies or vassals of the empire, they all became the
      implacable enemies of the Huns; and the numbers of that haughty people, as
      soon as they were reduced to their native strength, might, perhaps, have
      been contained within the walls of one of the great and populous cities of
      China. <a href="#Blink26note-39" id="Blink26noteref-39" name="Blink26noteref-39">39</a> The desertion of his subjects, and the
      perplexity of a civil war, at length compelled the Tanjou himself to
      renounce the dignity of an independent sovereign, and the freedom of a
      warlike and high-spirited nation. He was received at Sigan, the capital of
      the monarchy, by the troops, the mandarins, and the emperor himself, with
      all the honors that could adorn and disguise the triumph of Chinese
      vanity. <a href="#Blink26note-40" id="Blink26noteref-40" name="Blink26noteref-40">40</a> A magnificent palace was prepared for his
      reception; his place was assigned above all the princes of the royal
      family; and the patience of the Barbarian king was exhausted by the
      ceremonies of a banquet, which consisted of eight courses of meat, and of
      nine solemn pieces of music. But he performed, on his knees, the duty of a
      respectful homage to the emperor of China; pronounced, in his own name,
      and in the name of his successors, a perpetual oath of fidelity; and
      gratefully accepted a seal, which was bestowed as the emblem of his regal
      dependence. After this humiliating submission, the Tanjous sometimes
      departed from their allegiance and seized the favorable moments of war and
      rapine; but the monarchy of the Huns gradually declined, till it was
      broken, by civil dissension, into two hostile and separate kingdoms. One
      of the princes of the nation was urged, by fear and ambition, to retire
      towards the South with eight hords, which composed between forty and fifty
      thousand families. He obtained, with the title of Tanjou, a convenient
      territory on the verge of the Chinese provinces; and his constant
      attachment to the service of the empire was secured by weakness, and the
      desire of revenge. From the time of this fatal schism, the Huns of the
      North continued to languish about fifty years; till they were oppressed on
      every side by their foreign and domestic enemies. The proud inscription <a href="#Blink26note-41" id="Blink26noteref-41" name="Blink26noteref-41">41</a>
      of a column, erected on a lofty mountain, announced to posterity, that a
      Chinese army had marched seven hundred miles into the heart of their
      country. The Sienpi, <a href="#Blink26note-42" id="Blink26noteref-42" name="Blink26noteref-42">42</a> a tribe of Oriental Tartars, retaliated the
      injuries which they had formerly sustained; and the power of the Tanjous,
      after a reign of thirteen hundred years, was utterly destroyed before the
      end of the first century of the Christian aera. <a href="#Blink26note-43" id="Blink26noteref-43" name="Blink26noteref-43">43</a>

    </p>
<p>
      The fate of the vanquished Huns was diversified by the various influence
      of character and situation. <a href="#Blink26note-44" id="Blink26noteref-44" name="Blink26noteref-44">44</a> Above one hundred
      thousand persons, the poorest, indeed, and the most pusillanimous of the
      people, were contented to remain in their native country, to renounce
      their peculiar name and origin, and to mingle with the victorious nation
      of the Sienpi. Fifty-eight hords, about two hundred thousand men,
      ambitious of a more honorable servitude, retired towards the South;
      implored the protection of the emperors of China; and were permitted to
      inhabit, and to guard, the extreme frontiers of the province of Chansi and
      the territory of Ortous. But the most warlike and powerful tribes of the
      Huns maintained, in their adverse fortune, the undaunted spirit of their
      ancestors. The Western world was open to their valor; and they resolved,
      under the conduct of their hereditary chieftains, to conquer and subdue
      some remote country, which was still inaccessible to the arms of the
      Sienpi, and to the laws of China. <a href="#Blink26note-45" id="Blink26noteref-45" name="Blink26noteref-45">45</a> The course of their
      emigration soon carried them beyond the mountains of Imaus, and the limits
      of the Chinese geography; but we are able to distinguish the two great
      divisions of these formidable exiles, which directed their march towards
      the Oxus, and towards the Volga. The first of these colonies established
      their dominion in the fruitful and extensive plains of Sogdiana, on the
      eastern side of the Caspian; where they preserved the name of Huns, with
      the epithet of Euthalites, or Nepthalites. <a href="#Blink26note-4511" id="Blink26noteref-4511" name="Blink26noteref-4511">4511</a> Their manners
      were softened, and even their features were insensibly improved, by the
      mildness of the climate, and their long residence in a flourishing
      province, <a href="#Blink26note-46" id="Blink26noteref-46" name="Blink26noteref-46">46</a> which might still retain a faint impression
      of the arts of Greece. <a href="#Blink26note-47" id="Blink26noteref-47" name="Blink26noteref-47">47</a> The white Huns, a name which they derived
      from the change of their complexions, soon abandoned the pastoral life of
      Scythia. Gorgo, which, under the appellation of Carizme, has since enjoyed
      a temporary splendor, was the residence of the king, who exercised a legal
      authority over an obedient people. Their luxury was maintained by the
      labor of the Sogdians; and the only vestige of their ancient barbarism,
      was the custom which obliged all the companions, perhaps to the number of
      twenty, who had shared the liberality of a wealthy lord, to be buried
      alive in the same grave. <a href="#Blink26note-48" id="Blink26noteref-48" name="Blink26noteref-48">48</a> The vicinity of the Huns to the provinces of
      Persia, involved them in frequent and bloody contests with the power of
      that monarchy. But they respected, in peace, the faith of treaties; in
      war, she dictates of humanity; and their memorable victory over Peroses,
      or Firuz, displayed the moderation, as well as the valor, of the
      Barbarians. The second division of their countrymen, the Huns, who
      gradually advanced towards the North-west, were exercised by the hardships
      of a colder climate, and a more laborious march. Necessity compelled them
      to exchange the silks of China for the furs of Siberia; the imperfect
      rudiments of civilized life were obliterated; and the native fierceness of
      the Huns was exasperated by their intercourse with the savage tribes, who
      were compared, with some propriety, to the wild beasts of the desert.
      Their independent spirit soon rejected the hereditary succession of the
      Tanjous; and while each horde was governed by its peculiar mursa, their
      tumultuary council directed the public measures of the whole nation. As
      late as the thirteenth century, their transient residence on the eastern
      banks of the Volga was attested by the name of Great Hungary. <a href="#Blink26note-49" id="Blink26noteref-49" name="Blink26noteref-49">49</a>
      In the winter, they descended with their flocks and herds towards the
      mouth of that mighty river; and their summer excursions reached as high as
      the latitude of Saratoff, or perhaps the conflux of the Kama. Such at
      least were the recent limits of the black Calmucks, <a href="#Blink26note-50" id="Blink26noteref-50" name="Blink26noteref-50">50</a>

      distant emigrations of the ancient Huns. <a href="#Blink26note-51" id="Blink26noteref-51" name="Blink26noteref-51">51</a>

      It is impossible to fill the dark interval of time, which elapsed, after
      the Huns of the Volga were lost in the eyes of the Chinese, and before
      they showed themselves to those of the Romans. There is some reason,
      however, to apprehend, that the same force which had driven them from
      their native seats, still continued to impel their march towards the
      frontiers of Europe. The power of the Sienpi, their implacable enemies,
      which extended above three thousand miles from East to West, <a href="#Blink26note-52" id="Blink26noteref-52" name="Blink26noteref-52">52</a>
      must have gradually oppressed them by the weight and terror of a
      formidable neighborhood; and the flight of the tribes of Scythia would
      inevitably tend to increase the strength or to contract the territories,
      of the Huns. The harsh and obscure appellations of those tribes would
      offend the ear, without informing the understanding, of the reader; but I
      cannot suppress the very natural suspicion, that the Huns of the North
      derived a considerable reenforcement from the ruin of the dynasty of the
      South, which, in the course of the third century, submitted to the
      dominion of China; that the bravest warriors marched away in search of
      their free and adventurous countrymen; and that, as they had been divided
      by prosperity, they were easily reunited by the common hardships of their
      adverse fortune. <a href="#Blink26note-53" id="Blink26noteref-53" name="Blink26noteref-53">53</a> The Huns, with their flocks and herds, their
      wives and children, their dependents and allies, were transported to the
      west of the Volga, and they boldly advanced to invade the country of the
      Alani, a pastoral people, who occupied, or wasted, an extensive tract of
      the deserts of Scythia. The plains between the Volga and the Tanais were
      covered with the tents of the Alani, but their name and manners were
      diffused over the wide extent of their conquests; and the painted tribes
      of the Agathyrsi and Geloni were confounded among their vassals. Towards
      the North, they penetrated into the frozen regions of Siberia, among the
      savages who were accustomed, in their rage or hunger, to the taste of
      human flesh; and their Southern inroads were pushed as far as the confines
      of Persia and India. The mixture of Samartic and German blood had
      contributed to improve the features of the Alani, <a href="#Blink26note-5311" id="Blink26noteref-5311" name="Blink26noteref-5311">5311</a>
      to whiten their swarthy complexions, and to tinge their hair with a
      yellowish cast, which is seldom found in the Tartar race. They were less
      deformed in their persons, less brutish in their manners, than the Huns;
      but they did not yield to those formidable Barbarians in their martial and
      independent spirit; in the love of freedom, which rejected even the use of
      domestic slaves; and in the love of arms, which considered war and rapine
      as the pleasure and the glory of mankind. A naked cimeter, fixed in the
      ground, was the only object of their religious worship; the scalps of
      their enemies formed the costly trappings of their horses; and they
      viewed, with pity and contempt, the pusillanimous warriors, who patiently
      expected the infirmities of age, and the tortures of lingering disease. <a href="#Blink26note-54" id="Blink26noteref-54" name="Blink26noteref-54">54</a>
      On the banks of the Tanais, the military power of the Huns and the Alani
      encountered each other with equal valor, but with unequal success. The
      Huns prevailed in the bloody contest; the king of the Alani was slain; and
      the remains of the vanquished nation were dispersed by the ordinary
      alternative of flight or submission. <a href="#Blink26note-55" id="Blink26noteref-55" name="Blink26noteref-55">55</a> A colony of exiles
      found a secure refuge in the mountains of Caucasus, between the Euxine and
      the Caspian, where they still preserve their name and their independence.
      Another colony advanced, with more intrepid courage, towards the shores of
      the Baltic; associated themselves with the Northern tribes of Germany; and
      shared the spoil of the Roman provinces of Gaul and Spain. But the
      greatest part of the nation of the Alani embraced the offers of an
      honorable and advantageous union; and the Huns, who esteemed the valor of
      their less fortunate enemies, proceeded, with an increase of numbers and
      confidence, to invade the limits of the Gothic empire.

<p>
      The great Hermanric, whose dominions extended from the Baltic to the
      Euxine, enjoyed, in the full maturity of age and reputation, the fruit of
      his victories, when he was alarmed by the formidable approach of a host of
      unknown enemies, <a href="#Blink26note-56" id="Blink26noteref-56" name="Blink26noteref-56">56</a> on whom his barbarous subjects might, without
      injustice, bestow the epithet of Barbarians. The numbers, the strength,
      the rapid motions, and the implacable cruelty of the Huns, were felt, and
      dreaded, and magnified, by the astonished Goths; who beheld their fields
      and villages consumed with flames, and deluged with indiscriminate
      slaughter. To these real terrors they added the surprise and abhorrence
      which were excited by the shrill voice, the uncouth gestures, and the
      strange deformity of the Huns. <a href="#Blink26note-5611" id="Blink26noteref-5611" name="Blink26noteref-5611">5611</a> These savages
      of Scythia were compared (and the picture had some resemblance) to the
      animals who walk very awkwardly on two legs and to the misshapen figures,
      the Termini, which were often placed on the bridges of antiquity. They
      were distinguished from the rest of the human species by their broad
      shoulders, flat noses, and small black eyes, deeply buried in the head;
      and as they were almost destitute of beards, they never enjoyed either the
      manly grace of youth, or the venerable aspect of age. <a href="#Blink26note-57" id="Blink26noteref-57" name="Blink26noteref-57">57</a>
      A fabulous origin was assigned, worthy of their form and manners; that the
      witches of Scythia, who, for their foul and deadly practices, had been
      driven from society, had copulated in the desert with infernal spirits;
      and that the Huns were the offspring of this execrable conjunction. <a href="#Blink26note-58" id="Blink26noteref-58" name="Blink26noteref-58">58</a>
      The tale, so full of horror and absurdity, was greedily embraced by the
      credulous hatred of the Goths; but, while it gratified their hatred, it
      increased their fear, since the posterity of daemons and witches might be
      supposed to inherit some share of the praeternatural powers, as well as of
      the malignant temper, of their parents. Against these enemies, Hermanric
      prepared to exert the united forces of the Gothic state; but he soon
      discovered that his vassal tribes, provoked by oppression, were much more
      inclined to second, than to repel, the invasion of the Huns. One of the
      chiefs of the Roxolani <a href="#Blink26note-59" id="Blink26noteref-59" name="Blink26noteref-59">59</a> had formerly deserted the standard of
      Hermanric, and the cruel tyrant had condemned the innocent wife of the
      traitor to be torn asunder by wild horses. The brothers of that
      unfortunate woman seized the favorable moment of revenge.
    </p>
<p>
      The aged king of the Goths languished some time after the dangerous wound
      which he received from their daggers; but the conduct of the war was
      retarded by his infirmities; and the public councils of the nation were
      distracted by a spirit of jealousy and discord. His death, which has been
      imputed to his own despair, left the reins of government in the hands of
      Withimer, who, with the doubtful aid of some Scythian mercenaries,
      maintained the unequal contest against the arms of the Huns and the Alani,
      till he was defeated and slain in a decisive battle. The Ostrogoths
      submitted to their fate; and the royal race of the Amali will hereafter be
      found among the subjects of the haughty Attila. But the person of
      Witheric, the infant king, was saved by the diligence of Alatheus and
      Saphrax; two warriors of approved valor and fiedlity, who, by cautious
      marches, conducted the independent remains of the nation of the Ostrogoths
      towards the Danastus, or Niester; a considerable river, which now
      separates the Turkish dominions from the empire of Russia. On the banks of
      the Niester, the prudent Athanaric, more attentive to his own than to the
      general safety, had fixed the camp of the Visigoths; with the firm
      resolution of opposing the victorious Barbarians, whom he thought it less
      advisable to provoke. The ordinary speed of the Huns was checked by the
      weight of baggage, and the encumbrance of captives; but their military
      skill deceived, and almost destroyed, the army of Athanaric. While the
      Judge of the Visigoths defended the banks of the Niester, he was
      encompassed and attacked by a numerous detachment of cavalry, who, by the
      light of the moon, had passed the river in a fordable place; and it was
      not without the utmost efforts of courage and conduct, that he was able to
      effect his retreat towards the hilly country. The undaunted general had
      already formed a new and judicious plan of defensive war; and the strong
      lines, which he was preparing to construct between the mountains, the
      Pruth, and the Danube, would have secured the extensive and fertile
      territory that bears the modern name of Walachia, from the destructive
      inroads of the Huns. <a href="#Blink26note-60" id="Blink26noteref-60" name="Blink26noteref-60">60</a> But the hopes and measures of the Judge of
      the Visigoths was soon disappointed, by the trembling impatience of his
      dismayed countrymen; who were persuaded by their fears, that the
      interposition of the Danube was the only barrier that could save them from
      the rapid pursuit, and invincible valor, of the Barbarians of Scythia.
      Under the command of Fritigern and Alavivus, <a href="#Blink26note-61" id="Blink26noteref-61" name="Blink26noteref-61">61</a> the body of the
      nation hastily advanced to the banks of the great river, and implored the
      protection of the Roman emperor of the East. Athanaric himself, still
      anxious to avoid the guilt of perjury, retired, with a band of faithful
      followers, into the mountainous country of Caucaland; which appears to
      have been guarded, and almost concealed, by the impenetrable forests of

      After Valens had terminated the Gothic war with some appearance of glory
      and success, he made a progress through his dominions of Asia, and at
      length fixed his residence in the capital of Syria. The five years <a href="#Blink26note-63" id="Blink26noteref-63" name="Blink26noteref-63">63</a>
      which he spent at Antioch was employed to watch, from a secure distance,
      the hostile designs of the Persian monarch; to check the depredations of
      the Saracens and Isaurians; <a href="#Blink26note-64" id="Blink26noteref-64" name="Blink26noteref-64">64</a> to enforce, by
      arguments more prevalent than those of reason and eloquence, the belief of
      the Arian theology; and to satisfy his anxious suspicions by the
      promiscuous execution of the innocent and the guilty. But the attention of
      the emperor was most seriously engaged, by the important intelligence
      which he received from the civil and military officers who were intrusted
      with the defence of the Danube. He was informed, that the North was
      agitated by a furious tempest; that the irruption of the Huns, an unknown
      and monstrous race of savages, had subverted the power of the Goths; and
      that the suppliant multitudes of that warlike nation, whose pride was now
      humbled in the dust, covered a space of many miles along the banks of the
      river. With outstretched arms, and pathetic lamentations, they loudly
      deplored their past misfortunes and their present danger; acknowledged
      that their only hope of safety was in the clemency of the Roman
      government; and most solemnly protested, that if the gracious liberality
      of the emperor would permit them to cultivate the waste lands of Thrace,
      they should ever hold themselves bound, by the strongest obligations of
      duty and gratitude, to obey the laws, and to guard the limits, of the
      republic. These assurances were confirmed by the ambassadors of the Goths,
      <a href="#Blink26note-6411" id="Blink26noteref-6411" name="Blink26noteref-6411">6411</a> who impatiently expected from the mouth
      of Valens an answer that must finally determine the fate of their unhappy
      countrymen. The emperor of the East was no longer guided by the wisdom and
      authority of his elder brother, whose death happened towards the end of
      the preceding year; and as the distressful situation of the Goths required
      an instant and peremptory decision, he was deprived of the favorite
      resources of feeble and timid minds, who consider the use of dilatory and
      ambiguous measures as the most admirable efforts of consummate prudence.
      As long as the same passions and interests subsist among mankind, the
      questions of war and peace, of justice and policy, which were debated in
      the councils of antiquity, will frequently present themselves as the
      subject of modern deliberation. But the most experienced statesman of
      Europe has never been summoned to consider the propriety, or the danger,
      of admitting, or rejecting, an innumerable multitude of Barbarians, who
      are driven by despair and hunger to solicit a settlement on the
      territories of a civilized nation. When that important proposition, so
      essentially connected with the public safety, was referred to the
      ministers of Valens, they were perplexed and divided; but they soon
      acquiesced in the flattering sentiment which seemed the most favorable to
      the pride, the indolence, and the avarice of their sovereign. The slaves,
      who were decorated with the titles of praefects and generals, dissembled
      or disregarded the terrors of this national emigration; so extremely
      different from the partial and accidental colonies, which had been
      received on the extreme limits of the empire. But they applauded the
      liberality of fortune, which had conducted, from the most distant
      countries of the globe, a numerous and invincible army of strangers, to
      defend the throne of Valens; who might now add to the royal treasures the
      immense sums of gold supplied by the provincials to compensate their
      annual proportion of recruits. The prayers of the Goths were granted, and
      their service was accepted by the Imperial court: and orders were
      immediately despatched to the civil and military governors of the Thracian
      diocese, to make the necessary preparations for the passage and
      subsistence of a great people, till a proper and sufficient territory
      could be allotted for their future residence. The liberality of the
      emperor was accompanied, however, with two harsh and rigorous conditions,
      which prudence might justify on the side of the Romans; but which distress
      alone could extort from the indignant Goths. Before they passed the
      Danube, they were required to deliver their arms: and it was insisted,
      that their children should be taken from them, and dispersed through the
      provinces of Asia; where they might be civilized by the arts of education,
      and serve as hostages to secure the fidelity of their parents.

      During the suspense of a doubtful and distant negotiation, the impatient
      Goths made some rash attempts to pass the Danube, without the permission
      of the government, whose protection they had implored. Their motions were
      strictly observed by the vigilance of the troops which were stationed
      along the river and their foremost detachments were defeated with
      considerable slaughter; yet such were the timid councils of the reign of
      Valens, that the brave officers who had served their country in the
      execution of their duty, were punished by the loss of their employments,
      and narrowly escaped the loss of their heads. The Imperial mandate was at
      length received for transporting over the Danube the whole body of the
      Gothic nation; <a href="#Blink26note-65" id="Blink26noteref-65" name="Blink26noteref-65">65</a> but the execution of this order was a task of
      labor and difficulty. The stream of the Danube, which in those parts is
      above a mile broad, <a href="#Blink26note-66" id="Blink26noteref-66" name="Blink26noteref-66">66</a> had been swelled by incessant rains; and in
      this tumultuous passage, many were swept away, and drowned, by the rapid
      violence of the current. A large fleet of vessels, of boats, and of
      canoes, was provided; many days and nights they passed and repassed with
      indefatigable toil; and the most strenuous diligence was exerted by the
      officers of Valens, that not a single Barbarian, of those who were
      reserved to subvert the foundations of Rome, should be left on the
      opposite shore. It was thought expedient that an accurate account should
      be taken of their numbers; but the persons who were employed soon
      desisted, with amazement and dismay, from the prosecution of the endless
      and impracticable task: <a href="#Blink26note-67" id="Blink26noteref-67" name="Blink26noteref-67">67</a> and the principal historian of the age most
      seriously affirms, that the prodigious armies of Darius and Xerxes, which
      had so long been considered as the fables of vain and credulous antiquity,
      were now justified, in the eyes of mankind, by the evidence of fact and
      experience. A probable testimony has fixed the number of the Gothic
      warriors at two hundred thousand men: and if we can venture to add the
      just proportion of women, of children, and of slaves, the whole mass of
      people which composed this formidable emigration, must have amounted to
      near a million of persons, of both sexes, and of all ages. The children of
      the Goths, those at least of a distinguished rank, were separated from the
      multitude. They were conducted, without delay, to the distant seats
      assigned for their residence and education; and as the numerous train of
      hostages or captives passed through the cities, their gay and splendid
      apparel, their robust and martial figure, excited the surprise and envy of
      the Provincials. <a href="#Blink26note-6711" id="Blink26noteref-6711" name="Blink26noteref-6711">6711</a> But the stipulation, the most offensive
      to the Goths, and the most important to the Romans, was shamefully eluded.
      The Barbarians, who considered their arms as the ensigns of honor and the
      pledges of safety, were disposed to offer a price, which the lust or
      avarice of the Imperial officers was easily tempted to accept. To preserve
      their arms, the haughty warriors consented, with some reluctance, to
      prostitute their wives or their daughters; the charms of a beauteous maid,
      or a comely boy, secured the connivance of the inspectors; who sometimes
      cast an eye of covetousness on the fringed carpets and linen garments of
      their new allies, <a href="#Blink26note-68" id="Blink26noteref-68" name="Blink26noteref-68">68</a> or who sacrificed their duty to the mean
      consideration of filling their farms with cattle, and their houses with
      slaves. The Goths, with arms in their hands, were permitted to enter the
      boats; and when their strength was collected on the other side of the
      river, the immense camp which was spread over the plains and the hills of
      the Lower Maesia, assumed a threatening and even hostile aspect. The
      leaders of the Ostrogoths, Alatheus and Saphrax, the guardians of their
      infant king, appeared soon afterwards on the Northern banks of the Danube;
      and immediately despatched their ambassadors to the court of Antioch, to
      solicit, with the same professions of allegiance and gratitude, the same
      favor which had been granted to the suppliant Visigoths. The absolute
      refusal of Valens suspended their progress, and discovered the repentance,
      the suspicions, and the fears, of the Imperial council.

      'adamantine silence.' To the Romans they pretended to be generally

      enough to wear black raiment, to be wicked, and held in respect."
      (Eunapius hated the "black-robed monks," as appears in another passage,
      with the cordial detestation of a heathen philosopher.) "Thus, while they
      faithfully but secretly adhered to their own religion, the Romans were
      weak enough to suppose them perfect Christians." Mai, 277. Eunapius in

<p>
      An undisciplined and unsettled nation of Barbarians required the firmest
      temper, and the most dexterous management. The daily subsistence of near a
      million of extraordinary subjects could be supplied only by constant and
      skilful diligence, and might continually be interrupted by mistake or
      accident. The insolence, or the indignation, of the Goths, if they
      conceived themselves to be the objects either of fear or of contempt,
      might urge them to the most desperate extremities; and the fortune of the
      state seemed to depend on the prudence, as well as the integrity, of the
      generals of Valens. At this important crisis, the military government of
      Thrace was exercised by Lupicinus and Maximus, in whose venal minds the
      slightest hope of private emolument outweighed every consideration of
      public advantage; and whose guilt was only alleviated by their incapacity
      of discerning the pernicious effects of their rash and criminal
      administration.
    </p>
<p>
      Instead of obeying the orders of their sovereign, and satisfying, with
      decent liberality, the demands of the Goths, they levied an ungenerous and
      oppressive tax on the wants of the hungry Barbarians. The vilest food was
      sold at an extravagant price; and, in the room of wholesome and
      substantial provisions, the markets were filled with the flesh of dogs,
      and of unclean animals, who had died of disease. To obtain the valuable
      acquisition of a pound of bread, the Goths resigned the possession of an
      expensive, though serviceable, slave; and a small quantity of meat was
      greedily purchased with ten pounds of a precious, but useless metal, <a href="#Blink26note-69" id="Blink26noteref-69" name="Blink26noteref-69">69</a>
      when their property was exhausted, they continued this necessary traffic
      by the sale of their sons and daughters; and notwithstanding the love of
      freedom, which animated every Gothic breast, they submitted to the
      humiliating maxim, that it was better for their children to be maintained
      in a servile condition, than to perish in a state of wretched and helpless
      independence. The most lively resentment is excited by the tyranny of
      pretended benefactors, who sternly exact the debt of gratitude which they
      have cancelled by subsequent injuries: a spirit of discontent insensibly
      arose in the camp of the Barbarians, who pleaded, without success, the
      merit of their patient and dutiful behavior; and loudly complained of the
      inhospitable treatment which they had received from their new allies. They
      beheld around them the wealth and plenty of a fertile province, in the
      midst of which they suffered the intolerable hardships of artificial
      famine. But the means of relief, and even of revenge, were in their hands;
      since the rapaciousness of their tyrants had left to an injured people the
      possession and the use of arms. The clamors of a multitude, untaught to
      disguise their sentiments, announced the first symptoms of resistance, and
      alarmed the timid and guilty minds of Lupicinus and Maximus. Those crafty
      ministers, who substituted the cunning of temporary expedients to the wise
      and salutary counsels of general policy, attempted to remove the Goths
      from their dangerous station on the frontiers of the empire; and to
      disperse them, in separate quarters of cantonment, through the interior
      provinces. As they were conscious how ill they had deserved the respect,
      or confidence, of the Barbarians, they diligently collected, from every
      side, a military force, that might urge the tardy and reluctant march of a
      people, who had not yet renounced the title, or the duties, of Roman
      subjects. But the generals of Valens, while their attention was solely
      directed to the discontented Visigoths, imprudently disarmed the ships and
      the fortifications which constituted the defence of the Danube. The fatal
      oversight was observed, and improved, by Alatheus and Saphrax, who
      anxiously watched the favorable moment of escaping from the pursuit of the
      Huns. By the help of such rafts and vessels as could be hastily procured,
      the leaders of the Ostrogoths transported, without opposition, their king
      and their army; and boldly fixed a hostile and independent camp on the
      territories of the empire. <a href="#Blink26note-70" id="Blink26noteref-70" name="Blink26noteref-70">70</a>

      Under the name of Judges, Alavivus and Fritigern were the leaders of the
      Visigoths in peace and war; and the authority which they derived from
      their birth was ratified by the free consent of the nation. In a season of
      tranquility, their power might have been equal, as well as their rank;
      but, as soon as their countrymen were exasperated by hunger and
      oppression, the superior abilities of Fritigern assumed the military
      command, which he was qualified to exercise for the public welfare. He
      restrained the impatient spirit of the Visigoths till the injuries and the
      insults of their tyrants should justify their resistance in the opinion of
      mankind: but he was not disposed to sacrifice any solid advantages for the
      empty praise of justice and moderation. Sensible of the benefits which
      would result from the union of the Gothic powers under the same standard,
      he secretly cultivated the friendship of the Ostrogoths; and while he
      professed an implicit obedience to the orders of the Roman generals, he
      proceeded by slow marches towards Marcianopolis, the capital of the Lower
      Maesia, about seventy miles from the banks of the Danube. On that fatal
      spot, the flames of discord and mutual hatred burst forth into a dreadful
      conflagration. Lupicinus had invited the Gothic chiefs to a splendid
      entertainment; and their martial train remained under arms at the entrance
      of the palace. But the gates of the city were strictly guarded, and the
      Barbarians were sternly excluded from the use of a plentiful market, to
      which they asserted their equal claim of subjects and allies. Their humble
      prayers were rejected with insolence and derision; and as their patience
      was now exhausted, the townsmen, the soldiers, and the Goths, were soon
      involved in a conflict of passionate altercation and angry reproaches. A
      blow was imprudently given; a sword was hastily drawn; and the first blood
      that was spilt in this accidental quarrel, became the signal of a long and
      destructive war. In the midst of noise and brutal intemperance, Lupicinus
      was informed, by a secret messenger, that many of his soldiers were slain,
      and despoiled of their arms; and as he was already inflamed by wine, and
      oppressed by sleep he issued a rash command, that their death should be
      revenged by the massacre of the guards of Fritigern and Alavivus.
    </p>
<p>
      The clamorous shouts and dying groans apprised Fritigern of his extreme
      danger; and, as he possessed the calm and intrepid spirit of a hero, he
      saw that he was lost if he allowed a moment of deliberation to the man who
      had so deeply injured him. "A trifling dispute," said the Gothic leader,
      with a firm but gentle tone of voice, "appears to have arisen between the
      two nations; but it may be productive of the most dangerous consequences,
      unless the tumult is immediately pacified by the assurance of our safety,
      and the authority of our presence." At these words, Fritigern and his
      companions drew their swords, opened their passage through the unresisting
      crowd, which filled the palace, the streets, and the gates, of
      Marcianopolis, and, mounting their horses, hastily vanished from the eyes
      of the astonished Romans. The generals of the Goths were saluted by the
      fierce and joyful acclamations of the camp; war was instantly resolved,
      and the resolution was executed without delay: the banners of the nation
      were displayed according to the custom of their ancestors; and the air
      resounded with the harsh and mournful music of the Barbarian trumpet. <a href="#Blink26note-71" id="Blink26noteref-71" name="Blink26noteref-71">71</a>
      The weak and guilty Lupicinus, who had dared to provoke, who had neglected
      to destroy, and who still presumed to despise, his formidable enemy,
      marched against the Goths, at the head of such a military force as could
      be collected on this sudden emergency. The Barbarians expected his
      approach about nine miles from Marcianopolis; and on this occasion the
      talents of the general were found to be of more prevailing efficacy than
      the weapons and discipline of the troops. The valor of the Goths was so
      ably directed by the genius of Fritigern, that they broke, by a close and
      vigorous attack, the ranks of the Roman legions. Lupicinus left his arms
      and standards, his tribunes and his bravest soldiers, on the field of
      battle; and their useless courage served only to protect the ignominious
      flight of their leader. "That successful day put an end to the distress of
      the Barbarians, and the security of the Romans: from that day, the Goths,
      renouncing the precarious condition of strangers and exiles, assumed the
      character of citizens and masters, claimed an absolute dominion over the
      possessors of land, and held, in their own right, the northern provinces
      of the empire, which are bounded by the Danube." Such are the words of the
      Gothic historian, <a href="#Blink26note-72" id="Blink26noteref-72" name="Blink26noteref-72">72</a> who celebrates, with rude eloquence, the
      glory of his countrymen. But the dominion of the Barbarians was exercised
      only for the purposes of rapine and destruction. As they had been
      deprived, by the ministers of the emperor, of the common benefits of
      nature, and the fair intercourse of social life, they retaliated the
      injustice on the subjects of the empire; and the crimes of Lupicinus were
      expiated by the ruin of the peaceful husbandmen of Thrace, the
      conflagration of their villages, and the massacre, or captivity, of their
      innocent families. The report of the Gothic victory was soon diffused over
      the adjacent country; and while it filled the minds of the Romans with
      terror and dismay, their own hasty imprudence contributed to increase the
      forces of Fritigern, and the calamities of the province. Some time before
      the great emigration, a numerous body of Goths, under the command of
      Suerid and Colias, had been received into the protection and service of
      the empire. <a href="#Blink26note-73" id="Blink26noteref-73" name="Blink26noteref-73">73</a> They were encamped under the walls of
      Hadrianople; but the ministers of Valens were anxious to remove them
      beyond the Hellespont, at a distance from the dangerous temptation which
      might so easily be communicated by the neighborhood, and the success, of
      their countrymen. The respectful submission with which they yielded to the
      order of their march, might be considered as a proof of their fidelity;
      and their moderate request of a sufficient allowance of provisions, and of
      a delay of only two days was expressed in the most dutiful terms. But the
      first magistrate of Hadrianople, incensed by some disorders which had been
      committed at his country-house, refused this indulgence; and arming
      against them the inhabitants and manufacturers of a populous city, he
      urged, with hostile threats, their instant departure. The Barbarians stood
      silent and amazed, till they were exasperated by the insulting clamors,
      and missile weapons, of the populace: but when patience or contempt was
      fatigued, they crushed the undisciplined multitude, inflicted many a
      shameful wound on the backs of their flying enemies, and despoiled them of
      the splendid armor, <a href="#Blink26note-74" id="Blink26noteref-74" name="Blink26noteref-74">74</a> which they were unworthy to bear. The
      resemblance of their sufferings and their actions soon united this
      victorious detachment to the nation of the Visigoths; the troops of Colias
      and Suerid expected the approach of the great Fritigern, ranged themselves
      under his standard, and signalized their ardor in the siege of
      Hadrianople. But the resistance of the garrison informed the Barbarians,
      that in the attack of regular fortifications, the efforts of unskillful
      courage are seldom effectual. Their general acknowledged his error, raised
      the siege, declared that "he was at peace with stone walls," <a href="#Blink26note-75" id="Blink26noteref-75" name="Blink26noteref-75">75</a>
      and revenged his disappointment on the adjacent country. He accepted, with
      pleasure, the useful reenforcement of hardy workmen, who labored in the
      gold mines of Thrace, <a href="#Blink26note-76" id="Blink26noteref-76" name="Blink26noteref-76">76</a> for the emolument, and under the lash, of an
      unfeeling master: <a href="#Blink26note-77" id="Blink26noteref-77" name="Blink26noteref-77">77</a> and these new associates conducted the
      Barbarians, through the secret paths, to the most sequestered places,
      which had been chosen to secure the inhabitants, the cattle, and the
      magazines of corn. With the assistance of such guides, nothing could
      remain impervious or inaccessible; resistance was fatal; flight was
      impracticable; and the patient submission of helpless innocence seldom
      found mercy from the Barbarian conqueror. In the course of these
      depredations, a great number of the children of the Goths, who had been
      sold into captivity, were restored to the embraces of their afflicted
      parents; but these tender interviews, which might have revived and
      cherished in their minds some sentiments of humanity, tended only to
      stimulate their native fierceness by the desire of revenge. They listened,
      with eager attention, to the complaints of their captive children, who had
      suffered the most cruel indignities from the lustful or angry passions of
      their masters, and the same cruelties, the same indignities, were severely
      retaliated on the sons and daughters of the Romans. <a href="#Blink26note-78" id="Blink26noteref-78" name="Blink26noteref-78">78</a>

    </p>
<p>
      The imprudence of Valens and his ministers had introduced into the heart
      of the empire a nation of enemies; but the Visigoths might even yet have
      been reconciled, by the manly confession of past errors, and the sincere
      performance of former engagements. These healing and temperate measures
      seemed to concur with the timorous disposition of the sovereign of the
      East: but, on this occasion alone, Valens was brave; and his unseasonable
      bravery was fatal to himself and to his subjects. He declared his
      intention of marching from Antioch to Constantinople, to subdue this
      dangerous rebellion; and, as he was not ignorant of the difficulties of
      the enterprise, he solicited the assistance of his nephew, the emperor
      Gratian, who commanded all the forces of the West. The veteran troops were
      hastily recalled from the defence of Armenia; that important frontier was
      abandoned to the discretion of Sapor; and the immediate conduct of the
      Gothic war was intrusted, during the absence of Valens, to his lieutenants
      Trajan and Profuturus, two generals who indulged themselves in a very
      false and favorable opinion of their own abilities. On their arrival in
      Thrace, they were joined by Richomer, count of the domestics; and the
      auxiliaries of the West, that marched under his banner, were composed of
      the Gallic legions, reduced indeed, by a spirit of desertion, to the vain
      appearances of strength and numbers. In a council of war, which was
      influenced by pride, rather than by reason, it was resolved to seek, and
      to encounter, the Barbarians, who lay encamped in the spacious and fertile
      meadows, near the most southern of the six mouths of the Danube. <a href="#Blink26note-79" id="Blink26noteref-79" name="Blink26noteref-79">79</a>
      Their camp was surrounded by the usual fortification of wagons; <a href="#Blink26note-80" id="Blink26noteref-80" name="Blink26noteref-80">80</a>
      and the Barbarians, secure within the vast circle of the enclosure,
      enjoyed the fruits of their valor, and the spoils of the province. In the
      midst of riotous intemperance, the watchful Fritigern observed the
      motions, and penetrated the designs, of the Romans. He perceived, that the
      numbers of the enemy were continually increasing: and, as he understood
      their intention of attacking his rear, as soon as the scarcity of forage
      should oblige him to remove his camp, he recalled to their standard his
      predatory detachments, which covered the adjacent country. As soon as they
      descried the flaming beacons, <a href="#Blink26note-81" id="Blink26noteref-81" name="Blink26noteref-81">81</a> they obeyed, with
      incredible speed, the signal of their leader: the camp was filled with the
      martial crowd of Barbarians; their impatient clamors demanded the battle,
      and their tumultuous zeal was approved and animated by the spirit of their
      chiefs. The evening was already far advanced; and the two armies prepared
      themselves for the approaching combat, which was deferred only till the
      dawn of day.
    </p>
<p>
      While the trumpets sounded to arms, the undaunted courage of the Goths was
      confirmed by the mutual obligation of a solemn oath; and as they advanced
      to meet the enemy, the rude songs, which celebrated the glory of their
      forefathers, were mingled with their fierce and dissonant outcries, and
      opposed to the artificial harmony of the Roman shout. Some military skill
      was displayed by Fritigern to gain the advantage of a commanding eminence;
      but the bloody conflict, which began and ended with the light, was
      maintained on either side, by the personal and obstinate efforts of
      strength, valor, and agility. The legions of Armenia supported their fame
      in arms; but they were oppressed by the irresistible weight of the hostile
      multitude the left wing of the Romans was thrown into disorder and the
      field was strewed with their mangled carcasses. This partial defeat was
      balanced, however, by partial success; and when the two armies, at a late
      hour of the evening, retreated to their respective camps, neither of them
      could claim the honors, or the effects, of a decisive victory. The real
      loss was more severely felt by the Romans, in proportion to the smallness
      of their numbers; but the Goths were so deeply confounded and dismayed by
      this vigorous, and perhaps unexpected, resistance, that they remained
      seven days within the circle of their fortifications. Such funeral rites,
      as the circumstances of time and place would admit, were piously
      discharged to some officers of distinguished rank; but the indiscriminate
      vulgar was left unburied on the plain. Their flesh was greedily devoured
      by the birds of prey, who in that age enjoyed very frequent and delicious
      feasts; and several years afterwards the white and naked bones, which
      covered the wide extent of the fields, presented to the eyes of Ammianus a
      dreadful monument of the battle of Salices. <a href="#Blink26note-82" id="Blink26noteref-82" name="Blink26noteref-82">82</a>

<p>
      The progress of the Goths had been checked by the doubtful event of that
      bloody day; and the Imperial generals, whose army would have been consumed
      by the repetition of such a contest, embraced the more rational plan of
      destroying the Barbarians by the wants and pressure of their own
      multitudes. They prepared to confine the Visigoths in the narrow angle of
      land between the Danube, the desert of Scythia, and the mountains of
      Haemus, till their strength and spirit should be insensibly wasted by the
      inevitable operation of famine. The design was prosecuted with some
      conduct and success: the Barbarians had almost exhausted their own
      magazines, and the harvests of the country; and the diligence of
      Saturninus, the master-general of the cavalry, was employed to improve the
      strength, and to contract the extent, of the Roman fortifications. His
      labors were interrupted by the alarming intelligence, that new swarms of
      Barbarians had passed the unguarded Danube, either to support the cause,
      or to imitate the example, of Fritigern. The just apprehension, that he
      himself might be surrounded, and overwhelmed, by the arms of hostile and
      unknown nations, compelled Saturninus to relinquish the siege of the
      Gothic camp; and the indignant Visigoths, breaking from their confinement,
      satiated their hunger and revenge by the repeated devastation of the
      fruitful country, which extends above three hundred miles from the banks
      of the Danube to the straits of the Hellespont. <a href="#Blink26note-83" id="Blink26noteref-83" name="Blink26noteref-83">83</a> The sagacious
      Fritigern had successfully appealed to the passions, as well as to the
      interest, of his Barbarian allies; and the love of rapine, and the hatred
      of Rome, seconded, or even prevented, the eloquence of his ambassadors. He
      cemented a strict and useful alliance with the great body of his
      countrymen, who obeyed Alatheus and Saphrax as the guardians of their
      infant king: the long animosity of rival tribes was suspended by the sense
      of their common interest; the independent part of the nation was
      associated under one standard; and the chiefs of the Ostrogoths appear to
      have yielded to the superior genius of the general of the Visigoths. He
      obtained the formidable aid of the Taifalae, <a href="#Blink26note-8311" id="Blink26noteref-8311" name="Blink26noteref-8311">8311</a> whose military
      renown was disgraced and polluted by the public infamy of their domestic
      manners. Every youth, on his entrance into the world, was united by the
      ties of honorable friendship, and brutal love, to some warrior of the
      tribe; nor could he hope to be released from this unnatural connection,
      till he had approved his manhood by slaying, in single combat, a huge
      bear, or a wild boar of the forest. <a href="#Blink26note-84" id="Blink26noteref-84" name="Blink26noteref-84">84</a> But the most powerful
      auxiliaries of the Goths were drawn from the camp of those enemies who had
      expelled them from their native seats. The loose subordination, and
      extensive possessions, of the Huns and the Alani, delayed the conquests,
      and distracted the councils, of that victorious people. Several of the
      hords were allured by the liberal promises of Fritigern; and the rapid
      cavalry of Scythia added weight and energy to the steady and strenuous
      efforts of the Gothic infantry. The Sarmatians, who could never forgive
      the successor of Valentinian, enjoyed and increased the general confusion;
      and a seasonable irruption of the Alemanni, into the provinces of Gaul,
      engaged the attention, and diverted the forces, of the emperor of the
      West. <a href="#Blink26note-85" id="Blink26noteref-85" name="Blink26noteref-85">85</a>

      One of the most dangerous inconveniences of the introduction of the
      Barbarians into the army and the palace, was sensibly felt in their
      correspondence with their hostile countrymen; to whom they imprudently, or
      maliciously, revealed the weakness of the Roman empire. A soldier, of the
      lifeguards of Gratian, was of the nation of the Alemanni, and of the tribe
      of the Lentienses, who dwelt beyond the Lake of Constance. Some domestic
      business obliged him to request a leave of absence. In a short visit to
      his family and friends, he was exposed to their curious inquiries: and the
      vanity of the loquacious soldier tempted him to display his intimate
      acquaintance with the secrets of the state, and the designs of his master.
      The intelligence, that Gratian was preparing to lead the military force of
      Gaul, and of the West, to the assistance of his uncle Valens, pointed out
      to the restless spirit of the Alemanni the moment, and the mode, of a
      successful invasion. The enterprise of some light detachments, who, in the
      month of February, passed the Rhine upon the ice, was the prelude of a
      more important war. The boldest hopes of rapine, perhaps of conquest,
      outweighed the considerations of timid prudence, or national faith. Every
      forest, and every village, poured forth a band of hardy adventurers; and
      the great army of the Alemanni, which, on their approach, was estimated at
      forty thousand men by the fears of the people, was afterwards magnified to
      the number of seventy thousand by the vain and credulous flattery of the
      Imperial court. The legions, which had been ordered to march into
      Pannonia, were immediately recalled, or detained, for the defence of Gaul;
      the military command was divided between Nanienus and Mellobaudes; and the
      youthful emperor, though he respected the long experience and sober wisdom
      of the former, was much more inclined to admire, and to follow, the
      martial ardor of his colleague; who was allowed to unite the incompatible
      characters of count of the domestics, and of king of the Franks. His rival
      Priarius, king of the Alemanni, was guided, or rather impelled, by the
      same headstrong valor; and as their troops were animated by the spirit of
      their leaders, they met, they saw, they encountered each other, near the
      town of Argentaria, or Colmar, <a href="#Blink26note-86" id="Blink26noteref-86" name="Blink26noteref-86">86</a> in the plains of
      Alsace. The glory of the day was justly ascribed to the missile weapons,
      and well-practised evolutions, of the Roman soldiers; the Alemanni, who
      long maintained their ground, were slaughtered with unrelenting fury; five
      thousand only of the Barbarians escaped to the woods and mountains; and
      the glorious death of their king on the field of battle saved him from the
      reproaches of the people, who are always disposed to accuse the justice,
      or policy, of an unsuccessful war. After this signal victory, which
      secured the peace of Gaul, and asserted the honor of the Roman arms, the
      emperor Gratian appeared to proceed without delay on his Eastern
      expedition; but as he approached the confines of the Alemanni, he suddenly
      inclined to the left, surprised them by his unexpected passage of the
      Rhine, and boldly advanced into the heart of their country. The Barbarians
      opposed to his progress the obstacles of nature and of courage; and still
      continued to retreat, from one hill to another, till they were satisfied,
      by repeated trials, of the power and perseverance of their enemies. Their
      submission was accepted as a proof, not indeed of their sincere
      repentance, but of their actual distress; and a select number of their
      brave and robust youth was exacted from the faithless nation, as the most
      substantial pledge of their future moderation. The subjects of the empire,
      who had so often experienced that the Alemanni could neither be subdued by
      arms, nor restrained by treaties, might not promise themselves any solid
      or lasting tranquillity: but they discovered, in the virtues of their
      young sovereign, the prospect of a long and auspicious reign. When the
      legions climbed the mountains, and scaled the fortifications of the
      Barbarians, the valor of Gratian was distinguished in the foremost ranks;
      and the gilt and variegated armor of his guards was pierced and shattered
      by the blows which they had received in their constant attachment to the
      person of their sovereign. At the age of nineteen, the son of Valentinian
      seemed to possess the talents of peace and war; and his personal success
      against the Alemanni was interpreted as a sure presage of his Gothic
      triumphs. <a href="#Blink26note-87" id="Blink26noteref-87" name="Blink26noteref-87">87</a>

      While Gratian deserved and enjoyed the applause of his subjects, the
      emperor Valens, who, at length, had removed his court and army from
      Antioch, was received by the people of Constantinople as the author of the
      public calamity. Before he had reposed himself ten days in the capital, he
      was urged by the licentious clamors of the Hippodrome to march against the
      Barbarians, whom he had invited into his dominions; and the citizens, who
      are always brave at a distance from any real danger, declared, with
      confidence, that, if they were supplied with arms, they alone would
      undertake to deliver the province from the ravages of an insulting foe. <a href="#Blink26note-88" id="Blink26noteref-88" name="Blink26noteref-88">88</a>
      The vain reproaches of an ignorant multitude hastened the downfall of the
      Roman empire; they provoked the desperate rashness of Valens; who did not
      find, either in his reputation or in his mind, any motives to support with
      firmness the public contempt. He was soon persuaded, by the successful
      achievements of his lieutenants, to despise the power of the Goths, who,
      by the diligence of Fritigern, were now collected in the neighborhood of
      Hadrianople. The march of the Taifalae had been intercepted by the valiant
      Frigeric: the king of those licentious Barbarians was slain in battle; and
      the suppliant captives were sent into distant exile to cultivate the lands
      of Italy, which were assigned for their settlement in the vacant
      territories of Modena and Parma. <a href="#Blink26note-89" id="Blink26noteref-89" name="Blink26noteref-89">89</a> The exploits of
      Sebastian, <a href="#Blink26note-90" id="Blink26noteref-90" name="Blink26noteref-90">90</a> who was recently engaged in the service of
      Valens, and promoted to the rank of master-general of the infantry, were
      still more honorable to himself, and useful to the republic. He obtained
      the permission of selecting three hundred soldiers from each of the
      legions; and this separate detachment soon acquired the spirit of
      discipline, and the exercise of arms, which were almost forgotten under
      the reign of Valens. By the vigor and conduct of Sebastian, a large body
      of the Goths were surprised in their camp; and the immense spoil, which
      was recovered from their hands, filled the city of Hadrianople, and the
      adjacent plain. The splendid narratives, which the general transmitted of
      his own exploits, alarmed the Imperial court by the appearance of superior
      merit; and though he cautiously insisted on the difficulties of the Gothic
      war, his valor was praised, his advice was rejected; and Valens, who
      listened with pride and pleasure to the flattering suggestions of the
      eunuchs of the palace, was impatient to seize the glory of an easy and
      assured conquest. His army was strengthened by a numerous reenforcement of
      veterans; and his march from Constantinople to Hadrianople was conducted
      with so much military skill, that he prevented the activity of the
      Barbarians, who designed to occupy the intermediate defiles, and to
      intercept either the troops themselves, or their convoys of provisions.
      The camp of Valens, which he pitched under the walls of Hadrianople, was
      fortified, according to the practice of the Romans, with a ditch and
      rampart; and a most important council was summoned, to decide the fate of
      the emperor and of the empire. The party of reason and of delay was
      strenuously maintained by Victor, who had corrected, by the lessons of
      experience, the native fierceness of the Sarmatian character; while
      Sebastian, with the flexible and obsequious eloquence of a courtier,
      represented every precaution, and every measure, that implied a doubt of
      immediate victory, as unworthy of the courage and majesty of their
      invincible monarch. The ruin of Valens was precipitated by the deceitful
      arts of Fritigern, and the prudent admonitions of the emperor of the West.
      The advantages of negotiating in the midst of war were perfectly
      understood by the general of the Barbarians; and a Christian ecclesiastic
      was despatched, as the holy minister of peace, to penetrate, and to
      perplex, the councils of the enemy. The misfortunes, as well as the
      provocations, of the Gothic nation, were forcibly and truly described by
      their ambassador; who protested, in the name of Fritigern, that he was
      still disposed to lay down his arms, or to employ them only in the defence
      of the empire; if he could secure for his wandering countrymen a tranquil
      settlement on the waste lands of Thrace, and a sufficient allowance of
      corn and cattle. But he added, in a whisper of confidential friendship,
      that the exasperated Barbarians were averse to these reasonable
      conditions; and that Fritigern was doubtful whether he could accomplish
      the conclusion of the treaty, unless he found himself supported by the
      presence and terrors of an Imperial army. About the same time, Count
      Richomer returned from the West to announce the defeat and submission of
      the Alemanni, to inform Valens that his nephew advanced by rapid marches
      at the head of the veteran and victorious legions of Gaul, and to request,
      in the name of Gratian and of the republic, that every dangerous and
      decisive measure might be suspended, till the junction of the two emperors
      should insure the success of the Gothic war. But the feeble sovereign of
      the East was actuated only by the fatal illusions of pride and jealousy.
      He disdained the importunate advice; he rejected the humiliating aid; he
      secretly compared the ignominious, at least the inglorious, period of his
      own reign, with the fame of a beardless youth; and Valens rushed into the
      field, to erect his imaginary trophy, before the diligence of his
      colleague could usurp any share of the triumphs of the day.

<p>
      On the ninth of August, a day which has deserved to be marked among the
      most inauspicious of the Roman Calendar, <a href="#Blink26note-91" id="Blink26noteref-91" name="Blink26noteref-91">91</a> the emperor Valens,
      leaving, under a strong guard, his baggage and military treasure, marched
      from Hadrianople to attack the Goths, who were encamped about twelve miles
      from the city. <a href="#Blink26note-92" id="Blink26noteref-92" name="Blink26noteref-92">92</a> By some mistake of the orders, or some
      ignorance of the ground, the right wing, or column of cavalry arrived in
      sight of the enemy, whilst the left was still at a considerable distance;
      the soldiers were compelled, in the sultry heat of summer, to precipitate
      their pace; and the line of battle was formed with tedious confusion and
      irregular delay. The Gothic cavalry had been detached to forage in the
      adjacent country; and Fritigern still continued to practise his customary
      arts. He despatched messengers of peace, made proposals, required
      hostages, and wasted the hours, till the Romans, exposed without shelter
      to the burning rays of the sun, were exhausted by thirst, hunger, and
      intolerable fatigue. The emperor was persuaded to send an ambassador to
      the Gothic camp; the zeal of Richomer, who alone had courage to accept the
      dangerous commission, was applauded; and the count of the domestics,
      adorned with the splendid ensigns of his dignity, had proceeded some way
      in the space between the two armies, when he was suddenly recalled by the
      alarm of battle. The hasty and imprudent attack was made by Bacurius the
      Iberian, who commanded a body of archers and targeteers; and as they
      advanced with rashness, they retreated with loss and disgrace. In the same
      moment, the flying squadrons of Alatheus and Saphrax, whose return was
      anxiously expected by the general of the Goths, descended like a whirlwind
      from the hills, swept across the plain, and added new terrors to the
      tumultuous, but irresistible charge of the Barbarian host. The event of
      the battle of Hadrianople, so fatal to Valens and to the empire, may be
      described in a few words: the Roman cavalry fled; the infantry was
      abandoned, surrounded, and cut in pieces. The most skilful evolutions, the
      firmest courage, are scarcely sufficient to extricate a body of foot,
      encompassed, on an open plain, by superior numbers of horse; but the
      troops of Valens, oppressed by the weight of the enemy and their own
      fears, were crowded into a narrow space, where it was impossible for them
      to extend their ranks, or even to use, with effect, their swords and
      javelins. In the midst of tumult, of slaughter, and of dismay, the
      emperor, deserted by his guards and wounded, as it was supposed, with an
      arrow, sought protection among the Lancearii and the Mattiarii, who still
      maintained their ground with some appearance of order and firmness. His
      faithful generals, Trajan and Victor, who perceived his danger, loudly
      exclaimed that all was lost, unless the person of the emperor could be
      saved. Some troops, animated by their exhortation, advanced to his relief:
      they found only a bloody spot, covered with a heap of broken arms and
      mangled bodies, without being able to discover their unfortunate prince,
      either among the living or the dead. Their search could not indeed be
      successful, if there is any truth in the circumstances with which some
      historians have related the death of the emperor.
    </p>
<p>
      By the care of his attendants, Valens was removed from the field of battle
      to a neighboring cottage, where they attempted to dress his wound, and to
      provide for his future safety. But this humble retreat was instantly
      surrounded by the enemy: they tried to force the door, they were provoked
      by a discharge of arrows from the roof, till at length, impatient of
      delay, they set fire to a pile of dry magots, and consumed the cottage
      with the Roman emperor and his train. Valens perished in the flames; and a
      youth, who dropped from the window, alone escaped, to attest the
      melancholy tale, and to inform the Goths of the inestimable prize which
      they had lost by their own rashness. A great number of brave and
      distinguished officers perished in the battle of Hadrianople, which
      equalled in the actual loss, and far surpassed in the fatal consequences,
      the misfortune which Rome had formerly sustained in the fields of Cannae.
      <a href="#Blink26note-93" id="Blink26noteref-93" name="Blink26noteref-93">93</a>
      Two master-generals of the cavalry and infantry, two great officers of the
      palace, and thirty-five tribunes, were found among the slain; and the
      death of Sebastian might satisfy the world, that he was the victim, as
      well as the author, of the public calamity. Above two thirds of the Roman
      army were destroyed: and the darkness of the night was esteemed a very
      favorable circumstance, as it served to conceal the flight of the
      multitude, and to protect the more orderly retreat of Victor and Richomer,
      who alone, amidst the general consternation, maintained the advantage of
      calm courage and regular discipline. <a href="#Blink26note-94" id="Blink26noteref-94" name="Blink26noteref-94">94</a>

      While the impressions of grief and terror were still recent in the minds
      of men, the most celebrated rhetorician of the age composed the funeral
      oration of a vanquished army, and of an unpopular prince, whose throne was
      already occupied by a stranger. "There are not wanting," says the candid
      Libanius, "those who arraign the prudence of the emperor, or who impute
      the public misfortune to the want of courage and discipline in the troops.
      For my own part, I reverence the memory of their former exploits: I
      reverence the glorious death, which they bravely received, standing, and
      fighting in their ranks: I reverence the field of battle, stained with
      their blood, and the blood of the Barbarians. Those honorable marks have
      been already washed away by the rains; but the lofty monuments of their
      bones, the bones of generals, of centurions, and of valiant warriors,
      claim a longer period of duration. The king himself fought and fell in the
      foremost ranks of the battle. His attendants presented him with the
      fleetest horses of the Imperial stable, that would soon have carried him
      beyond the pursuit of the enemy. They vainly pressed him to reserve his
      important life for the future service of the republic. He still declared
      that he was unworthy to survive so many of the bravest and most faithful
      of his subjects; and the monarch was nobly buried under a mountain of the
      slain. Let none, therefore, presume to ascribe the victory of the
      Barbarians to the fear, the weakness, or the imprudence, of the Roman
      troops. The chiefs and the soldiers were animated by the virtue of their
      ancestors, whom they equalled in discipline and the arts of war. Their
      generous emulation was supported by the love of glory, which prompted them
      to contend at the same time with heat and thirst, with fire and the sword;
      and cheerfully to embrace an honorable death, as their refuge against
      flight and infamy. The indignation of the gods has been the only cause of
      the success of our enemies." The truth of history may disclaim some parts
      of this panegyric, which cannot strictly be reconciled with the character
      of Valens, or the circumstances of the battle: but the fairest
      commendation is due to the eloquence, and still more to the generosity, of
      the sophist of Antioch. <a href="#Blink26note-95" id="Blink26noteref-95" name="Blink26noteref-95">95</a>

      The pride of the Goths was elated by this memorable victory; but their
      avarice was disappointed by the mortifying discovery, that the richest
      part of the Imperial spoil had been within the walls of Hadrianople. They
      hastened to possess the reward of their valor; but they were encountered
      by the remains of a vanquished army, with an intrepid resolution, which
      was the effect of their despair, and the only hope of their safety. The
      walls of the city, and the ramparts of the adjacent camp, were lined with
      military engines, that threw stones of an enormous weight; and astonished
      the ignorant Barbarians by the noise, and velocity, still more than by the
      real effects, of the discharge. The soldiers, the citizens, the
      provincials, the domestics of the palace, were united in the danger, and
      in the defence: the furious assault of the Goths was repulsed; their
      secret arts of treachery and treason were discovered; and, after an
      obstinate conflict of many hours, they retired to their tents; convinced,
      by experience, that it would be far more advisable to observe the treaty,
      which their sagacious leader had tacitly stipulated with the
      fortifications of great and populous cities. After the hasty and impolitic
      massacre of three hundred deserters, an act of justice extremely useful to
      the discipline of the Roman armies, the Goths indignantly raised the siege
      of Hadrianople. The scene of war and tumult was instantly converted into a
      silent solitude: the multitude suddenly disappeared; the secret paths of
      the woods and mountains were marked with the footsteps of the trembling
      fugitives, who sought a refuge in the distant cities of Illyricum and
      Macedonia; and the faithful officers of the household, and the treasury,
      cautiously proceeded in search of the emperor, of whose death they were
      still ignorant. The tide of the Gothic inundation rolled from the walls of
      Hadrianople to the suburbs of Constantinople. The Barbarians were
      surprised with the splendid appearance of the capital of the East, the
      height and extent of the walls, the myriads of wealthy and affrighted
      citizens who crowded the ramparts, and the various prospect of the sea and
      land. While they gazed with hopeless desire on the inaccessible beauties
      of Constantinople, a sally was made from one of the gates by a party of
      Saracens, <a href="#Blink26note-96" id="Blink26noteref-96" name="Blink26noteref-96">96</a> who had been fortunately engaged in the
      service of Valens. The cavalry of Scythia was forced to yield to the
      admirable swiftness and spirit of the Arabian horses: their riders were
      skilled in the evolutions of irregular war; and the Northern Barbarians
      were astonished and dismayed, by the inhuman ferocity of the Barbarians of
      the South.

      A Gothic soldier was slain by the dagger of an Arab; and the hairy, naked
      savage, applying his lips to the wound, expressed a horrid delight, while
      he sucked the blood of his vanquished enemy. <a href="#Blink26note-97" id="Blink26noteref-97" name="Blink26noteref-97">97</a> The army of the
      Goths, laden with the spoils of the wealthy suburbs and the adjacent
      territory, slowly moved, from the Bosphorus, to the mountains which form
      the western boundary of Thrace. The important pass of Succi was betrayed
      by the fear, or the misconduct, of Maurus; and the Barbarians, who no
      longer had any resistance to apprehend from the scattered and vanquished
      troops of the East, spread themselves over the face of a fertile and
      cultivated country, as far as the confines of Italy and the Hadriatic Sea.

      compassion, and their eloquence, for their own sufferings, when the
      provinces were invaded, and desolated, by the arms of the successful
      Barbarians. The simple circumstantial narrative (did such a narrative
      exist) of the ruin of a single town, of the misfortunes of a single

      and declamatory complaints would fatigue the attention of the most patient
      reader. The same censure may be applied, though not perhaps in an equal
      degree, to the profane, and the ecclesiastical, writers of this unhappy
      period; that their minds were inflamed by popular and religious animosity;
      and that the true size and color of every object is falsified by the
      exaggerations of their corrupt eloquence. The vehement Jerom <a href="#Blink26note-101" id="Blink26noteref-101" name="Blink26noteref-101">101</a>
      might justly deplore the calamities inflicted by the Goths, and their
      barbarous allies, on his native country of Pannonia, and the wide extent
      of the provinces, from the walls of Constantinople to the foot of the
      Julian Alps; the rapes, the massacres, the conflagrations; and, above all,
      the profanation of the churches, that were turned into stables, and the
      contemptuous treatment of the relics of holy martyrs. But the Saint is
      surely transported beyond the limits of nature and history, when he
      affirms, "that, in those desert countries, nothing was left except the sky
      and the earth; that, after the destruction of the cities, and the
      extirpation of the human race, the land was overgrown with thick forests
      and inextricable brambles; and that the universal desolation, announced by
      the prophet Zephaniah, was accomplished, in the scarcity of the beasts,
      the birds, and even of the fish." These complaints were pronounced about
      twenty years after the death of Valens; and the Illyrian provinces, which
      were constantly exposed to the invasion and passage of the Barbarians,
      still continued, after a calamitous period of ten centuries, to supply new
      materials for rapine and destruction. Could it even be supposed, that a
      large tract of country had been left without cultivation and without
      inhabitants, the consequences might not have been so fatal to the inferior
      productions of animated nature. The useful and feeble animals, which are
      nourished by the hand of man, might suffer and perish, if they were
      deprived of his protection; but the beasts of the forest, his enemies or
      his victims, would multiply in the free and undisturbed possession of
      their solitary domain. The various tribes that people the air, or the
      waters, are still less connected with the fate of the human species; and
      it is highly probable that the fish of the Danube would have felt more
      terror and distress, from the approach of a voracious pike, than from the
      hostile inroad of a Gothic army.

      Whatever may have been the just measure of the calamities of Europe, there
      was reason to fear that the same calamities would soon extend to the
      peaceful countries of Asia. The sons of the Goths had been judiciously
      distributed through the cities of the East; and the arts of education were
      employed to polish, and subdue, the native fierceness of their temper. In
      the space of about twelve years, their numbers had continually increased;
      and the children, who, in the first emigration, were sent over the
      Hellespont, had attained, with rapid growth, the strength and spirit of
      perfect manhood. <a href="#Blink26note-102" id="Blink26noteref-102" name="Blink26noteref-102">102</a> It was impossible to conceal from their
      knowledge the events of the Gothic war; and, as those daring youths had
      not studied the language of dissimulation, they betrayed their wish, their
      desire, perhaps their intention, to emulate the glorious example of their
      fathers The danger of the times seemed to justify the jealous suspicions
      of the provincials; and these suspicions were admitted as unquestionable
      evidence, that the Goths of Asia had formed a secret and dangerous
      conspiracy against the public safety. The death of Valens had left the
      East without a sovereign; and Julius, who filled the important station of
      master-general of the troops, with a high reputation of diligence and
      ability, thought it his duty to consult the senate of Constantinople;
      which he considered, during the vacancy of the throne, as the
      representative council of the nation. As soon as he had obtained the
      discretionary power of acting as he should judge most expedient for the
      good of the republic, he assembled the principal officers, and privately
      concerted effectual measures for the execution of his bloody design. An
      order was immediately promulgated, that, on a stated day, the Gothic youth
      should assemble in the capital cities of their respective provinces; and,
      as a report was industriously circulated, that they were summoned to
      receive a liberal gift of lands and money, the pleasing hope allayed the
      fury of their resentment, and, perhaps, suspended the motions of the
      conspiracy. On the appointed day, the unarmed crowd of the Gothic youth
      was carefully collected in the square or Forum; the streets and avenues
      were occupied by the Roman troops, and the roofs of the houses were
      covered with archers and slingers. At the same hour, in all the cities of
      the East, the signal was given of indiscriminate slaughter; and the
      provinces of Asia were delivered by the cruel prudence of Julius, from a
      domestic enemy, who, in a few months, might have carried fire and sword
      from the Hellespont to the Euphrates. <a href="#Blink26note-103" id="Blink26noteref-103" name="Blink26noteref-103">103</a> The urgent
      consideration of the public safety may undoubtedly authorize the violation

      doctrine of which I still desire to remain ignorant.

      The emperor Gratian was far advanced on his march towards the plains of
      Hadrianople, when he was informed, at first by the confused voice of fame,
      and afterwards by the more accurate reports of Victor and Richomer, that
      his impatient colleague had been slain in battle, and that two thirds of
      the Roman army were exterminated by the sword of the victorious Goths.
      Whatever resentment the rash and jealous vanity of his uncle might
      deserve, the resentment of a generous mind is easily subdued by the softer
      emotions of grief and compassion; and even the sense of pity was soon lost
      in the serious and alarming consideration of the state of the republic.
      Gratian was too late to assist, he was too weak to revenge, his
      unfortunate colleague; and the valiant and modest youth felt himself
      unequal to the support of a sinking world. A formidable tempest of the
      Barbarians of Germany seemed ready to burst over the provinces of Gaul;
      and the mind of Gratian was oppressed and distracted by the administration
      of the Western empire. In this important crisis, the government of the
      East, and the conduct of the Gothic war, required the undivided attention
      of a hero and a statesman. A subject invested with such ample command
      would not long have preserved his fidelity to a distant benefactor; and
      the Imperial council embraced the wise and manly resolution of conferring
      an obligation, rather than of yielding to an insult. It was the wish of
      Gratian to bestow the purple as the reward of virtue; but, at the age of
      nineteen, it is not easy for a prince, educated in the supreme rank, to
      understand the true characters of his ministers and generals. He attempted
      to weigh, with an impartial hand, their various merits and defects; and,
      whilst he checked the rash confidence of ambition, he distrusted the
      cautious wisdom which despaired of the republic. As each moment of delay
      diminished something of the power and resources of the future sovereign of
      the East, the situation of the times would not allow a tedious debate. The
      choice of Gratian was soon declared in favor of an exile, whose father,
      only three years before, had suffered, under the sanction of his
      authority, an unjust and ignominious death. The great Theodosius, a name
      celebrated in history, and dear to the Catholic church, <a href="#Blink26note-104" id="Blink26noteref-104" name="Blink26noteref-104">104</a>
      was summoned to the Imperial court, which had gradually retreated from the
      confines of Thrace to the more secure station of Sirmium. Five months
      after the death of Valens, the emperor Gratian produced before the
      assembled troops his colleague and their master; who, after a modest,
      perhaps a sincere, resistance, was compelled to accept, amidst the general
      acclamations, the diadem, the purple, and the equal title of Augustus. <a href="#Blink26note-105" id="Blink26noteref-105" name="Blink26noteref-105">105</a>
      The provinces of Thrace, Asia, and Egypt, over which Valens had reigned,
      were resigned to the administration of the new emperor; but, as he was
      specially intrusted with the conduct of the Gothic war, the Illyrian
      praefecture was dismembered; and the two great dioceses of Dacia and
      Macedonia were added to the dominions of the Eastern empire. <a href="#Blink26note-106" id="Blink26noteref-106" name="Blink26noteref-106">106</a>

      the throne the virtues of Trajan, and the talents of Hadrian, was the

      They emerged from the obscurity of municipal honors by the active spirit
      of the elder Theodosius, a general whose exploits in Britain and Africa
      have formed one of the most splendid parts of the annals of Valentinian.
      The son of that general, who likewise bore the name of Theodosius, was
      educated, by skilful preceptors, in the liberal studies of youth; but he
      was instructed in the art of war by the tender care and severe discipline
      of his father. <a href="#Blink26note-109" id="Blink26noteref-109" name="Blink26noteref-109">109</a> Under the standard of such a leader, young
      Theodosius sought glory and knowledge, in the most distant scenes of
      military action; inured his constitution to the difference of seasons and
      climates; distinguished his valor by sea and land; and observed the
      various warfare of the Scots, the Saxons, and the Moors. His own merit,
      and the recommendation of the conqueror of Africa, soon raised him to a
      separate command; and, in the station of Duke of Misaea, he vanquished an
      army of Sarmatians; saved the province; deserved the love of the soldiers;
      and provoked the envy of the court. <a href="#Blink26note-110" id="Blink26noteref-110" name="Blink26noteref-110">110</a> His rising
      fortunes were soon blasted by the disgrace and execution of his
      illustrious father; and Theodosius obtained, as a favor, the permission of
      retiring to a private life in his native province of Spain. He displayed a
      firm and temperate character in the ease with which he adapted himself to
      this new situation. His time was almost equally divided between the town
      and country; the spirit, which had animated his public conduct, was shown
      in the active and affectionate performance of every social duty; and the
      diligence of the soldier was profitably converted to the improvement of
      his ample patrimony, <a href="#Blink26note-111" id="Blink26noteref-111" name="Blink26noteref-111">111</a> which lay between Valladolid and Segovia,
      in the midst of a fruitful district, still famous for a most exquisite
      breed of sheep. <a href="#Blink26note-112" id="Blink26noteref-112" name="Blink26noteref-112">112</a> From the innocent, but humble labors of his
      farm, Theodosius was transported, in less than four months, to the throne
      of the Eastern empire; and the whole period of the history of the world
      will not perhaps afford a similar example, of an elevation at the same
      time so pure and so honorable. The princes who peaceably inherit the
      sceptre of their fathers, claim and enjoy a legal right, the more secure
      as it is absolutely distinct from the merits of their personal characters.
      The subjects, who, in a monarchy, or a popular state, acquire the
      possession of supreme power, may have raised themselves, by the
      superiority either of genius or virtue, above the heads of their equals;
      but their virtue is seldom exempt from ambition; and the cause of the
      successful candidate is frequently stained by the guilt of conspiracy, or
      civil war. Even in those governments which allow the reigning monarch to
      declare a colleague or a successor, his partial choice, which may be
      influenced by the blindest passions, is often directed to an unworthy
      object But the most suspicious malignity cannot ascribe to Theodosius, in
      his obscure solitude of Caucha, the arts, the desires, or even the hopes,
      of an ambitious statesman; and the name of the Exile would long since have
      been forgotten, if his genuine and distinguished virtues had not left a
      deep impression in the Imperial court. During the season of prosperity, he
      had been neglected; but, in the public distress, his superior merit was
      universally felt and acknowledged. What confidence must have been reposed
      in his integrity, since Gratian could trust, that a pious son would
      forgive, for the sake of the republic, the murder of his father! What
      expectations must have been formed of his abilities to encourage the hope,
      that a single man could save, and restore, the empire of the East!
      Theodosius was invested with the purple in the thirty-third year of his
      age. The vulgar gazed with admiration on the manly beauty of his face, and
      the graceful majesty of his person, which they were pleased to compare
      with the pictures and medals of the emperor Trajan; whilst intelligent
      observers discovered, in the qualities of his heart and understanding, a
      more important resemblance to the best and greatest of the Roman princes.

      It is not without the most sincere regret, that I must now take leave of
      an accurate and faithful guide, who has composed the history of his own
      times, without indulging the prejudices and passions, which usually affect
      the mind of a contemporary. Ammianus Marcellinus, who terminates his
      useful work with the defeat and death of Valens, recommends the more
      glorious subject of the ensuing reign to the youthful vigor and eloquence
      of the rising generation. <a href="#Blink26note-113" id="Blink26noteref-113" name="Blink26noteref-113">113</a> The rising
      generation was not disposed to accept his advice or to imitate his
      example; <a href="#Blink26note-114" id="Blink26noteref-114" name="Blink26noteref-114">114</a> and, in the study of the reign of
      Theodosius, we are reduced to illustrate the partial narrative of Zosimus,
      by the obscure hints of fragments and chronicles, by the figurative style
      of poetry or panegyric, and by the precarious assistance of the
      ecclesiastical writers, who, in the heat of religious faction, are apt to
      despise the profane virtues of sincerity and moderation. Conscious of
      these disadvantages, which will continue to involve a considerable portion
      of the decline and fall of the Roman empire, I shall proceed with doubtful
      and timorous steps. Yet I may boldly pronounce, that the battle of
      Hadrianople was never revenged by any signal or decisive victory of
      Theodosius over the Barbarians: and the expressive silence of his venal
      orators may be confirmed by the observation of the condition and
      circumstances of the times. The fabric of a mighty state, which has been
      reared by the labors of successive ages, could not be overturned by the
      misfortune of a single day, if the fatal power of the imagination did not
      exaggerate the real measure of the calamity. The loss of forty thousand
      Romans, who fell in the plains of Hadrianople, might have been soon
      recruited in the populous provinces of the East, which contained so many
      millions of inhabitants. The courage of a soldier is found to be the
      cheapest, and most common, quality of human nature; and sufficient skill
      to encounter an undisciplined foe might have been speedily taught by the
      care of the surviving centurions. If the Barbarians were mounted on the
      horses, and equipped with the armor, of their vanquished enemies, the
      numerous studs of Cappadocia and Spain would have supplied new squadrons
      of cavalry; the thirty-four arsenals of the empire were plentifully stored
      with magazines of offensive and defensive arms: and the wealth of Asia
      might still have yielded an ample fund for the expenses of the war. But
      the effects which were produced by the battle of Hadrianople on the minds
      of the Barbarians and of the Romans, extended the victory of the former,
      and the defeat of the latter, far beyond the limits of a single day. A
      Gothic chief was heard to declare, with insolent moderation, that, for his
      own part, he was fatigued with slaughter: but that he was astonished how a
      people, who fled before him like a flock of sheep, could still presume to
      dispute the possession of their treasures and provinces. <a href="#Blink26note-115" id="Blink26noteref-115" name="Blink26noteref-115">115</a>
      The same terrors which the name of the Huns had spread among the Gothic
      tribes, were inspired, by the formidable name of the Goths, among the
      subjects and soldiers of the Roman empire. <a href="#Blink26note-116" id="Blink26noteref-116" name="Blink26noteref-116">116</a> If Theodosius,
      hastily collecting his scattered forces, had led them into the field to
      encounter a victorious enemy, his army would have been vanquished by their
      own fears; and his rashness could not have been excused by the chance of
      success. But the great Theodosius, an epithet which he honorably deserved
      on this momentous occasion, conducted himself as the firm and faithful
      guardian of the republic. He fixed his head-quarters at Thessalonica, the
      capital of the Macedonian diocese; <a href="#Blink26note-117" id="Blink26noteref-117" name="Blink26noteref-117">117</a> from whence he
      could watch the irregular motions of the Barbarians, and direct the
      operations of his lieutenants, from the gates of Constantinople to the
      shores of the Hadriatic. The fortifications and garrisons of the cities
      were strengthened; and the troops, among whom a sense of order and
      discipline was revived, were insensibly emboldened by the confidence of
      their own safety. From these secure stations, they were encouraged to make
      frequent sallies on the Barbarians, who infested the adjacent country;
      and, as they were seldom allowed to engage, without some decisive
      superiority, either of ground or of numbers, their enterprises were, for
      the most part, successful; and they were soon convinced, by their own
      experience, of the possibility of vanquishing their invincible enemies.
      The detachments of these separate garrisons were generally united into
      small armies; the same cautious measures were pursued, according to an
      extensive and well-concerted plan of operations; the events of each day
      added strength and spirit to the Roman arms; and the artful diligence of
      the emperor, who circulated the most favorable reports of the success of
      the war, contributed to subdue the pride of the Barbarians, and to animate
      the hopes and courage of his subjects. If, instead of this faint and
      imperfect outline, we could accurately represent the counsels and actions
      of Theodosius, in four successive campaigns, there is reason to believe,
      that his consummate skill would deserve the applause of every military
      reader. The republic had formerly been saved by the delays of Fabius; and,
      while the splendid trophies of Scipio, in the field of Zama, attract the
      eyes of posterity, the camps and marches of the dictator among the hills
      of the Campania, may claim a juster proportion of the solid and
      independent fame, which the general is not compelled to share, either with
      fortune or with his troops. Such was likewise the merit of Theodosius; and
      the infirmities of his body, which most unseasonably languished under a
      long and dangerous disease, could not oppress the vigor of his mind, or
      divert his attention from the public service. <a href="#Blink26note-118" id="Blink26noteref-118" name="Blink26noteref-118">118</a>

<p>
      The deliverance and peace of the Roman provinces <a href="#Blink26note-119" id="Blink26noteref-119" name="Blink26noteref-119">119</a> was the work of
      prudence, rather than of valor: the prudence of Theodosius was seconded by
      fortune: and the emperor never failed to seize, and to improve, every
      favorable circumstance. As long as the superior genius of Fritigern
      preserved the union, and directed the motions of the Barbarians, their
      power was not inadequate to the conquest of a great empire. The death of
      that hero, the predecessor and master of the renowned Alaric, relieved an
      impatient multitude from the intolerable yoke of discipline and
      discretion. The Barbarians, who had been restrained by his authority,
      abandoned themselves to the dictates of their passions; and their passions
      were seldom uniform or consistent. An army of conquerors was broken into
      many disorderly bands of savage robbers; and their blind and irregular
      fury was not less pernicious to themselves, than to their enemies. Their
      mischievous disposition was shown in the destruction of every object which
      they wanted strength to remove, or taste to enjoy; and they often
      consumed, with improvident rage, the harvests, or the granaries, which
      soon afterwards became necessary for their own subsistence. A spirit of
      discord arose among the independent tribes and nations, which had been
      united only by the bands of a loose and voluntary alliance. The troops of
      the Huns and the Alani would naturally upbraid the flight of the Goths;
      who were not disposed to use with moderation the advantages of their
      fortune; the ancient jealousy of the Ostrogoths and the Visigoths could
      not long be suspended; and the haughty chiefs still remembered the insults
      and injuries, which they had reciprocally offered, or sustained, while the
      nation was seated in the countries beyond the Danube. The progress of
      domestic faction abated the more diffusive sentiment of national
      animosity; and the officers of Theodosius were instructed to purchase,
      with liberal gifts and promises, the retreat or service of the
      discontented party. The acquisition of Modar, a prince of the royal blood
      of the Amali, gave a bold and faithful champion to the cause of Rome. The
      illustrious deserter soon obtained the rank of master-general, with an
      important command; surprised an army of his countrymen, who were immersed
      in wine and sleep; and, after a cruel slaughter of the astonished Goths,
      returned with an immense spoil, and four thousand wagons, to the Imperial
      camp. <a href="#Blink26note-120" id="Blink26noteref-120" name="Blink26noteref-120">120</a> In the hands of a skilful politician, the
      most different means may be successfully applied to the same ends; and the
      peace of the empire, which had been forwarded by the divisions, was
      accomplished by the reunion, of the Gothic nation. Athanaric, who had been
      a patient spectator of these extraordinary events, was at length driven,
      by the chance of arms, from the dark recesses of the woods of Caucaland.
      He no longer hesitated to pass the Danube; and a very considerable part of
      the subjects of Fritigern, who already felt the inconveniences of anarchy,
      were easily persuaded to acknowledge for their king a Gothic Judge, whose
      birth they respected, and whose abilities they had frequently experienced.
      But age had chilled the daring spirit of Athanaric; and, instead of
      leading his people to the field of battle and victory, he wisely listened
      to the fair proposal of an honorable and advantageous treaty. Theodosius,
      who was acquainted with the merit and power of his new ally, condescended
      to meet him at the distance of several miles from Constantinople; and
      entertained him in the Imperial city, with the confidence of a friend, and
      the magnificence of a monarch. "The Barbarian prince observed, with
      curious attention, the variety of objects which attracted his notice, and
      at last broke out into a sincere and passionate exclamation of wonder. I
      now behold (said he) what I never could believe, the glories of this
      stupendous capital! And as he cast his eyes around, he viewed, and he
      admired, the commanding situation of the city, the strength and beauty of
      the walls and public edifices, the capacious harbor, crowded with
      innumerable vessels, the perpetual concourse of distant nations, and the
      arms and discipline of the troops. Indeed, (continued Athanaric,) the
      emperor of the Romans is a god upon earth; and the presumptuous man, who
      dares to lift his hand against him, is guilty of his own blood." <a href="#Blink26note-121" id="Blink26noteref-121" name="Blink26noteref-121">121</a>
      The Gothic king did not long enjoy this splendid and honorable reception;
      and, as temperance was not the virtue of his nation, it may justly be
      suspected, that his mortal disease was contracted amidst the pleasures of
      the Imperial banquets. But the policy of Theodosius derived more solid
      benefit from the death, than he could have expected from the most faithful
      services, of his ally. The funeral of Athanaric was performed with solemn
      rites in the capital of the East; a stately monument was erected to his
      memory; and his whole army, won by the liberal courtesy, and decent grief,
      of Theodosius, enlisted under the standard of the Roman empire. <a href="#Blink26note-122" id="Blink26noteref-122" name="Blink26noteref-122">122</a>
      The submission of so great a body of the Visigoths was productive of the
      most salutary consequences; and the mixed influence of force, of reason,
      and of corruption, became every day more powerful, and more extensive.
      Each independent chieftain hastened to obtain a separate treaty, from the
      apprehension that an obstinate delay might expose him, alone and
      unprotected, to the revenge, or justice, of the conqueror. The general, or
      rather the final, capitulation of the Goths, may be dated four years, one
      month, and twenty-five days, after the defeat and death of the emperor
      Valens. <a href="#Blink26note-123" id="Blink26noteref-123" name="Blink26noteref-123">123</a>

      The provinces of the Danube had been already relieved from the oppressive
      weight of the Gruthungi, or Ostrogoths, by the voluntary retreat of
      Alatheus and Saphrax, whose restless spirit had prompted them to seek new
      scenes of rapine and glory. Their destructive course was pointed towards
      the West; but we must be satisfied with a very obscure and imperfect
      knowledge of their various adventures. The Ostrogoths impelled several of
      the German tribes on the provinces of Gaul; concluded, and soon violated,
      a treaty with the emperor Gratian; advanced into the unknown countries of
      the North; and, after an interval of more than four years, returned, with
      accumulated force, to the banks of the Lower Danube. Their troops were
      recruited with the fiercest warriors of Germany and Scythia; and the
      soldiers, or at least the historians, of the empire, no longer recognized
      the name and countenances of their former enemies. <a href="#Blink26note-124" id="Blink26noteref-124" name="Blink26noteref-124">124</a>
      The general who commanded the military and naval powers of the Thracian
      frontier, soon perceived that his superiority would be disadvantageous to
      the public service; and that the Barbarians, awed by the presence of his
      fleet and legions, would probably defer the passage of the river till the
      approaching winter. The dexterity of the spies, whom he sent into the
      Gothic camp, allured the Barbarians into a fatal snare. They were
      persuaded that, by a bold attempt, they might surprise, in the silence and
      darkness of the night, the sleeping army of the Romans; and the whole
      multitude was hastily embarked in a fleet of three thousand canoes. <a href="#Blink26note-125" id="Blink26noteref-125" name="Blink26noteref-125">125</a>
      The bravest of the Ostrogoths led the van; the main body consisted of the
      remainder of their subjects and soldiers; and the women and children
      securely followed in the rear. One of the nights without a moon had been
      selected for the execution of their design; and they had almost reached
      the southern bank of the Danube, in the firm confidence that they should
      find an easy landing and an unguarded camp. But the progress of the
      Barbarians was suddenly stopped by an unexpected obstacle a triple line of
      vessels, strongly connected with each other, and which formed an
      impenetrable chain of two miles and a half along the river. While they
      struggled to force their way in the unequal conflict, their right flank
      was overwhelmed by the irresistible attack of a fleet of galleys, which
      were urged down the stream by the united impulse of oars and of the tide.
      The weight and velocity of those ships of war broke, and sunk, and
      dispersed, the rude and feeble canoes of the Barbarians; their valor was
      ineffectual; and Alatheus, the king, or general, of the Ostrogoths,
      perished with his bravest troops, either by the sword of the Romans, or in
      the waves of the Danube. The last division of this unfortunate fleet might
      regain the opposite shore; but the distress and disorder of the multitude
      rendered them alike incapable, either of action or counsel; and they soon
      implored the clemency of the victorious enemy. On this occasion, as well
      as on many others, it is a difficult task to reconcile the passions and
      prejudices of the writers of the age of Theodosius. The partial and
      malignant historian, who misrepresents every action of his reign, affirms,
      that the emperor did not appear in the field of battle till the Barbarians
      had been vanquished by the valor and conduct of his lieutenant Promotus.

      The flattering poet, who celebrated, in the court of Honorius, the glory
      of the father and of the son, ascribes the victory to the personal prowess
      of Theodosius; and almost insinuates, that the king of the Ostrogoths was
      slain by the hand of the emperor. <a href="#Blink26note-127" id="Blink26noteref-127" name="Blink26noteref-127">127</a> The truth of

      The original treaty which fixed the settlement of the Goths, ascertained
      their privileges, and stipulated their obligations, would illustrate the
      history of Theodosius and his successors. The series of their history has
      imperfectly preserved the spirit and substance of this single agreement.
      <a href="#Blink26note-128" id="Blink26noteref-128" name="Blink26noteref-128">128</a>
      The ravages of war and tyranny had provided many large tracts of fertile
      but uncultivated land for the use of those Barbarians who might not
      disdain the practice of agriculture. A numerous colony of the Visigoths
      was seated in Thrace; the remains of the Ostrogoths were planted in
      Phrygia and Lydia; their immediate wants were supplied by a distribution
      of corn and cattle; and their future industry was encouraged by an
      exemption from tribute, during a certain term of years. The Barbarians
      would have deserved to feel the cruel and perfidious policy of the
      Imperial court, if they had suffered themselves to be dispersed through
      the provinces. They required, and they obtained, the sole possession of
      the villages and districts assigned for their residence; they still
      cherished and propagated their native manners and language; asserted, in
      the bosom of despotism, the freedom of their domestic government; and
      acknowledged the sovereignty of the emperor, without submitting to the
      inferior jurisdiction of the laws and magistrates of Rome. The hereditary
      chiefs of the tribes and families were still permitted to command their
      followers in peace and war; but the royal dignity was abolished; and the
      generals of the Goths were appointed and removed at the pleasure of the
      emperor. An army of forty thousand Goths was maintained for the perpetual
      service of the empire of the East; and those haughty troops, who assumed
      the title of Foederati, or allies, were distinguished by their gold
      collars, liberal pay, and licentious privileges. Their native courage was
      improved by the use of arms and the knowledge of discipline; and, while
      the republic was guarded, or threatened, by the doubtful sword of the
      Barbarians, the last sparks of the military flame were finally
      extinguished in the minds of the Romans. <a href="#Blink26note-129" id="Blink26noteref-129" name="Blink26noteref-129">129</a> Theodosius had the
      address to persuade his allies, that the conditions of peace, which had
      been extorted from him by prudence and necessity, were the voluntary
      expressions of his sincere friendship for the Gothic nation. <a href="#Blink26note-130" id="Blink26noteref-130" name="Blink26noteref-130">130</a>
      A different mode of vindication or apology was opposed to the complaints
      of the people; who loudly censured these shameful and dangerous
      concessions. <a href="#Blink26note-131" id="Blink26noteref-131" name="Blink26noteref-131">131</a> The calamities of the war were painted in
      the most lively colors; and the first symptoms of the return of order, of
      plenty, and security, were diligently exaggerated. The advocates of
      Theodosius could affirm, with some appearance of truth and reason, that it
      was impossible to extirpate so many warlike tribes, who were rendered
      desperate by the loss of their native country; and that the exhausted
      provinces would be revived by a fresh supply of soldiers and husbandmen.
      The Barbarians still wore an angry and hostile aspect; but the experience
      of past times might encourage the hope, that they would acquire the habits
      of industry and obedience; that their manners would be polished by time,
      education, and the influence of Christianity; and that their posterity
      would insensibly blend with the great body of the Roman people. <a href="#Blink26note-132" id="Blink26noteref-132" name="Blink26noteref-132">132</a>

      Notwithstanding these specious arguments, and these sanguine expectations,
      it was apparent to every discerning eye, that the Goths would long remain
      the enemies, and might soon become the conquerors of the Roman empire.
      Their rude and insolent behavior expressed their contempt of the citizens
      and provincials, whom they insulted with impunity. <a href="#Blink26note-133" id="Blink26noteref-133" name="Blink26noteref-133">133</a>
      To the zeal and valor of the Barbarians Theodosius was indebted for the
      success of his arms: but their assistance was precarious; and they were
      sometimes seduced, by a treacherous and inconstant disposition, to abandon
      his standard, at the moment when their service was the most essential.
      During the civil war against Maximus, a great number of Gothic deserters
      retired into the morasses of Macedonia, wasted the adjacent provinces, and
      obliged the intrepid monarch to expose his person, and exert his power, to
      suppress the rising flame of rebellion. <a href="#Blink26note-134" id="Blink26noteref-134" name="Blink26noteref-134">134</a> The public
      apprehensions were fortified by the strong suspicion, that these tumults
      were not the effect of accidental passion, but the result of deep and
      premeditated design. It was generally believed, that the Goths had signed
      the treaty of peace with a hostile and insidious spirit; and that their
      chiefs had previously bound themselves, by a solemn and secret oath, never
      to keep faith with the Romans; to maintain the fairest show of loyalty and
      friendship, and to watch the favorable moment of rapine, of conquest, and
      of revenge. But as the minds of the Barbarians were not insensible to the
      power of gratitude, several of the Gothic leaders sincerely devoted
      themselves to the service of the empire, or, at least, of the emperor; the
      whole nation was insensibly divided into two opposite factions, and much
      sophistry was employed in conversation and dispute, to compare the
      obligations of their first, and second, engagements. The Goths, who
      considered themselves as the friends of peace, of justice, and of Rome,
      were directed by the authority of Fravitta, a valiant and honorable youth,
      distinguished above the rest of his countrymen by the politeness of his
      manners, the liberality of his sentiments, and the mild virtues of social
      life. But the more numerous faction adhered to the fierce and faithless
      Priulf, <a href="#Blink26note-13411" id="Blink26noteref-13411" name="Blink26noteref-13411">13411</a> who inflamed the passions, and asserted
      the independence, of his warlike followers. On one of the solemn
      festivals, when the chiefs of both parties were invited to the Imperial
      table, they were insensibly heated by wine, till they forgot the usual
      restraints of discretion and respect, and betrayed, in the presence of
      Theodosius, the fatal secret of their domestic disputes. The emperor, who
      had been the reluctant witness of this extraordinary controversy,
      dissembled his fears and resentment, and soon dismissed the tumultuous
      assembly. Fravitta, alarmed and exasperated by the insolence of his rival,
      whose departure from the palace might have been the signal of a civil war,
      boldly followed him; and, drawing his sword, laid Priulf dead at his feet.
      Their companions flew to arms; and the faithful champion of Rome would
      have been oppressed by superior numbers, if he had not been protected by
      the seasonable interposition of the Imperial guards. <a href="#Blink26note-135" id="Blink26noteref-135" name="Blink26noteref-135">135</a>
      Such were the scenes of Barbaric rage, which disgraced the palace and
      table of the Roman emperor; and, as the impatient Goths could only be
      restrained by the firm and temperate character of Theodosius, the public
      safety seemed to depend on the life and abilities of a single man. <a href="#Blink26note-136" id="Blink26noteref-136" name="Blink26noteref-136">136</a>
