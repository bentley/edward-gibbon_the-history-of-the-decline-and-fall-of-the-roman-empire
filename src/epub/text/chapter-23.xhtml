     The Religion Of Julian.—Universal Toleration.—He Attempts

</pre>
<p>
      The character of Apostate has injured the reputation of Julian; and the
      enthusiasm which clouded his virtues has exaggerated the real and apparent
      magnitude of his faults. Our partial ignorance may represent him as a
      philosophic monarch, who studied to protect, with an equal hand, the
      religious factions of the empire; and to allay the theological fever which
      had inflamed the minds of the people, from the edicts of Diocletian to the
      exile of Athanasius. A more accurate view of the character and conduct of
      Julian will remove this favorable prepossession for a prince who did not
      escape the general contagion of the times. We enjoy the singular advantage
      of comparing the pictures which have been delineated by his fondest
      admirers and his implacable enemies. The actions of Julian are faithfully
      related by a judicious and candid historian, the impartial spectator of
      his life and death. The unanimous evidence of his contemporaries is
      confirmed by the public and private declarations of the emperor himself;
      and his various writings express the uniform tenor of his religious
      sentiments, which policy would have prompted him to dissemble rather than
      to affect. A devout and sincere attachment for the gods of Athens and Rome
      constituted the ruling passion of Julian; <a href="#Blink23note-1" id="Blink23noteref-1" name="Blink23noteref-1">1</a> the powers of an
      enlightened understanding were betrayed and corrupted by the influence of
      superstitious prejudice; and the phantoms which existed only in the mind
      of the emperor had a real and pernicious effect on the government of the
      empire. The vehement zeal of the Christians, who despised the worship, and
      overturned the altars of those fabulous deities, engaged their votary in a
      state of irreconcilable hostility with a very numerous party of his
      subjects; and he was sometimes tempted by the desire of victory, or the
      shame of a repulse, to violate the laws of prudence, and even of justice.
      The triumph of the party, which he deserted and opposed, has fixed a stain
      of infamy on the name of Julian; and the unsuccessful apostate has been
      overwhelmed with a torrent of pious invectives, of which the signal was
      given by the sonorous trumpet <a href="#Blink23note-2" id="Blink23noteref-2" name="Blink23noteref-2">2</a> of Gregory Nazianzen. <a href="#Blink23note-3" id="Blink23noteref-3" name="Blink23noteref-3">3</a> The
      interesting nature of the events which were crowded into the short reign
      of this active emperor, deserve a just and circumstantial narrative. His
      motives, his counsels, and his actions, as far as they are connected with
      the history of religion, will be the subject of the present chapter.

      assistance from a French version and remarks, printed at Lyons, 1735.]
    </p>
<p>
      The cause of his strange and fatal apostasy may be derived from the early
      period of his life, when he was left an orphan in the hands of the
      murderers of his family. The names of Christ and of Constantius, the ideas
      of slavery and of religion, were soon associated in a youthful
      imagination, which was susceptible of the most lively impressions. The
      care of his infancy was intrusted to Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, <a href="#Blink23note-4" id="Blink23noteref-4" name="Blink23noteref-4">4</a> who
      was related to him on the side of his mother; and till Julian reached the
      twentieth year of his age, he received from his Christian preceptors the
      education, not of a hero, but of a saint. The emperor, less jealous of a
      heavenly than of an earthly crown, contented himself with the imperfect
      character of a catechumen, while he bestowed the advantages of baptism <a href="#Blink23note-5" id="Blink23noteref-5" name="Blink23noteref-5">5</a> on
      the nephews of Constantine. <a href="#Blink23note-6" id="Blink23noteref-6" name="Blink23noteref-6">6</a> They were even admitted to the inferior offices
      of the ecclesiastical order; and Julian publicly read the Holy Scriptures
      in the church of Nicomedia. The study of religion, which they assiduously
      cultivated, appeared to produce the fairest fruits of faith and devotion.
      <a href="#Blink23note-7" id="Blink23noteref-7" name="Blink23noteref-7">7</a>
      They prayed, they fasted, they distributed alms to the poor, gifts to the
      clergy, and oblations to the tombs of the martyrs; and the splendid
      monument of St. Mamas, at Caesarea, was erected, or at least was
      undertaken, by the joint labor of Gallus and Julian. <a href="#Blink23note-8" id="Blink23noteref-8" name="Blink23noteref-8">8</a>
      They respectfully conversed with the bishops, who were eminent for
      superior sanctity, and solicited the benediction of the monks and hermits,
      who had introduced into Cappadocia the voluntary hardships of the ascetic
      life. <a href="#Blink23note-9" id="Blink23noteref-9" name="Blink23noteref-9">9</a>
      As the two princes advanced towards the years of manhood, they discovered,
      in their religious sentiments, the difference of their characters. The
      dull and obstinate understanding of Gallus embraced, with implicit zeal,
      the doctrines of Christianity; which never influenced his conduct, or
      moderated his passions. The mild disposition of the younger brother was
      less repugnant to the precepts of the gospel; and his active curiosity
      might have been gratified by a theological system, which explains the
      mysterious essence of the Deity, and opens the boundless prospect of
      invisible and future worlds. But the independent spirit of Julian refused
      to yield the passive and unresisting obedience which was required, in the
      name of religion, by the haughty ministers of the church. Their
      speculative opinions were imposed as positive laws, and guarded by the
      terrors of eternal punishments; but while they prescribed the rigid
      formulary of the thoughts, the words, and the actions of the young prince;
      whilst they silenced his objections, and severely checked the freedom of
      his inquiries, they secretly provoked his impatient genius to disclaim the
      authority of his ecclesiastical guides. He was educated in the Lesser
      Asia, amidst the scandals of the Arian controversy. <a href="#Blink23note-10" id="Blink23noteref-10" name="Blink23noteref-10">10</a>
      The fierce contests of the Eastern bishops, the incessant alterations of
      their creeds, and the profane motives which appeared to actuate their
      conduct, insensibly strengthened the prejudice of Julian, that they
      neither understood nor believed the religion for which they so fiercely
      contended. Instead of listening to the proofs of Christianity with that
      favorable attention which adds weight to the most respectable evidence, he
      heard with suspicion, and disputed with obstinacy and acuteness, the
      doctrines for which he already entertained an invincible aversion.
      Whenever the young princes were directed to compose declamations on the
      subject of the prevailing controversies, Julian always declared himself
      the advocate of Paganism; under the specious excuse that, in the defence
      of the weaker cause, his learning and ingenuity might be more
      advantageously exercised and displayed.

    </p>
<p>
      As soon as Gallus was invested with the honors of the purple, Julian was
      permitted to breathe the air of freedom, of literature, and of Paganism.
      <a href="#Blink23note-11" id="Blink23noteref-11" name="Blink23noteref-11">11</a>
      The crowd of sophists, who were attracted by the taste and liberality of
      their royal pupil, had formed a strict alliance between the learning and
      the religion of Greece; and the poems of Homer, instead of being admired
      as the original productions of human genius, were seriously ascribed to
      the heavenly inspiration of Apollo and the muses. The deities of Olympus,
      as they are painted by the immortal bard, imprint themselves on the minds
      which are the least addicted to superstitious credulity. Our familiar
      knowledge of their names and characters, their forms and attributes, seems
      to bestow on those airy beings a real and substantial existence; and the
      pleasing enchantment produces an imperfect and momentary assent of the
      imagination to those fables, which are the most repugnant to our reason
      and experience. In the age of Julian, every circumstance contributed to
      prolong and fortify the illusion; the magnificent temples of Greece and
      Asia; the works of those artists who had expressed, in painting or in
      sculpture, the divine conceptions of the poet; the pomp of festivals and
      sacrifices; the successful arts of divination; the popular traditions of
      oracles and prodigies; and the ancient practice of two thousand years. The
      weakness of polytheism was, in some measure, excused by the moderation of
      its claims; and the devotion of the Pagans was not incompatible with the
      most licentious scepticism. <a href="#Blink23note-12" id="Blink23noteref-12" name="Blink23noteref-12">12</a> Instead of an
      indivisible and regular system, which occupies the whole extent of the
      believing mind, the mythology of the Greeks was composed of a thousand
      loose and flexible parts, and the servant of the gods was at liberty to
      define the degree and measure of his religious faith. The creed which
      Julian adopted for his own use was of the largest dimensions; and, by
      strange contradiction, he disdained the salutary yoke of the gospel,
      whilst he made a voluntary offering of his reason on the altars of Jupiter
      and Apollo. One of the orations of Julian is consecrated to the honor of
      Cybele, the mother of the gods, who required from her effeminate priests
      the bloody sacrifice, so rashly performed by the madness of the Phrygian
      boy. The pious emperor condescends to relate, without a blush, and without
      a smile, the voyage of the goddess from the shores of Pergamus to the
      mouth of the Tyber, and the stupendous miracle, which convinced the senate
      and people of Rome that the lump of clay, which their ambassadors had
      transported over the seas, was endowed with life, and sentiment, and
      divine power. <a href="#Blink23note-13" id="Blink23noteref-13" name="Blink23noteref-13">13</a> For the truth of this prodigy he appeals to
      the public monuments of the city; and censures, with some acrimony, the
      sickly and affected taste of those men, who impertinently derided the
      sacred traditions of their ancestors. <a href="#Blink23note-14" id="Blink23noteref-14" name="Blink23noteref-14">14</a>

<p>
      But the devout philosopher, who sincerely embraced, and warmly encouraged,
      the superstition of the people, reserved for himself the privilege of a
      liberal interpretation; and silently withdrew from the foot of the altars
      into the sanctuary of the temple. The extravagance of the Grecian
      mythology proclaimed, with a clear and audible voice, that the pious
      inquirer, instead of being scandalized or satisfied with the literal
      sense, should diligently explore the occult wisdom, which had been
      disguised, by the prudence of antiquity, under the mask of folly and of
      fable. <a href="#Blink23note-15" id="Blink23noteref-15" name="Blink23noteref-15">15</a> The philosophers of the Platonic school, <a href="#Blink23note-16" id="Blink23noteref-16" name="Blink23noteref-16">16</a>
      Plotinus, Porphyry, and the divine Iamblichus, were admired as the most
      skilful masters of this allegorical science, which labored to soften and
      harmonize the deformed features of Paganism. Julian himself, who was
      directed in the mysterious pursuit by Aedesius, the venerable successor of
      Iamblichus, aspired to the possession of a treasure, which he esteemed, if
      we may credit his solemn asseverations, far above the empire of the world.
      <a href="#Blink23note-17" id="Blink23noteref-17" name="Blink23noteref-17">17</a>
      It was indeed a treasure, which derived its value only from opinion; and
      every artist who flattered himself that he had extracted the precious ore
      from the surrounding dross, claimed an equal right of stamping the name
      and figure the most agreeable to his peculiar fancy. The fable of Atys and
      Cybele had been already explained by Porphyry; but his labors served only
      to animate the pious industry of Julian, who invented and published his
      own allegory of that ancient and mystic tale. This freedom of
      interpretation, which might gratify the pride of the Platonists, exposed
      the vanity of their art. Without a tedious detail, the modern reader could
      not form a just idea of the strange allusions, the forced etymologies, the
      solemn trifling, and the impenetrable obscurity of these sages, who
      professed to reveal the system of the universe. As the traditions of Pagan
      mythology were variously related, the sacred interpreters were at liberty
      to select the most convenient circumstances; and as they translated an
      arbitrary cipher, they could extract from any fable any sense which was
      adapted to their favorite system of religion and philosophy. The
      lascivious form of a naked Venus was tortured into the discovery of some
      moral precept, or some physical truth; and the castration of Atys
      explained the revolution of the sun between the tropics, or the separation
      of the human soul from vice and error. <a href="#Blink23note-18" id="Blink23noteref-18" name="Blink23noteref-18">18</a>

    </p>
<p>
      The theological system of Julian appears to have contained the sublime and
      important principles of natural religion. But as the faith, which is not
      founded on revelation, must remain destitute of any firm assurance, the
      disciple of Plato imprudently relapsed into the habits of vulgar
      superstition; and the popular and philosophic notion of the Deity seems to
      have been confounded in the practice, the writings, and even in the mind
      of Julian. <a href="#Blink23note-19" id="Blink23noteref-19" name="Blink23noteref-19">19</a> The pious emperor acknowledged and adored the
      Eternal Cause of the universe, to whom he ascribed all the perfections of
      an infinite nature, invisible to the eyes and inaccessible to the
      understanding, of feeble mortals. The Supreme God had created, or rather,
      in the Platonic language, had generated, the gradual succession of
      dependent spirits, of gods, of daemons, of heroes, and of men; and every
      being which derived its existence immediately from the First Cause,
      received the inherent gift of immortality. That so precious an advantage
      might be lavished upon unworthy objects, the Creator had intrusted to the
      skill and power of the inferior gods the office of forming the human body,
      and of arranging the beautiful harmony of the animal, the vegetable, and
      the mineral kingdoms. To the conduct of these divine ministers he
      delegated the temporal government of this lower world; but their imperfect
      administration is not exempt from discord or error. The earth and its
      inhabitants are divided among them, and the characters of Mars or Minerva,
      of Mercury or Venus, may be distinctly traced in the laws and manners of
      their peculiar votaries. As long as our immortal souls are confined in a
      mortal prison, it is our interest, as well as our duty, to solicit the
      favor, and to deprecate the wrath, of the powers of heaven; whose pride is
      gratified by the devotion of mankind; and whose grosser parts may be
      supposed to derive some nourishment from the fumes of sacrifice. <a href="#Blink23note-20" id="Blink23noteref-20" name="Blink23noteref-20">20</a>
      The inferior gods might sometimes condescend to animate the statues, and
      to inhabit the temples, which were dedicated to their honor. They might
      occasionally visit the earth, but the heavens were the proper throne and
      symbol of their glory. The invariable order of the sun, moon, and stars,
      was hastily admitted by Julian, as a proof of their eternal duration; and
      their eternity was a sufficient evidence that they were the workmanship,
      not of an inferior deity, but of the Omnipotent King. In the system of
      Platonists, the visible was a type of the invisible world. The celestial
      bodies, as they were informed by a divine spirit, might be considered as
      the objects the most worthy of religious worship. The Sun, whose genial
      influence pervades and sustains the universe, justly claimed the adoration
      of mankind, as the bright representative of the Logos, the lively, the
      rational, the beneficent image of the intellectual Father. <a href="#Blink23note-21" id="Blink23noteref-21" name="Blink23noteref-21">21</a>

<p>
      The devout and fearless curiosity of Julian tempted the philosophers with
      the hopes of an easy conquest; which, from the situation of their young
      proselyte, might be productive of the most important consequences. <a href="#Blink23note-23" id="Blink23noteref-23" name="Blink23noteref-23">23</a>
      Julian imbibed the first rudiments of the Platonic doctrines from the
      mouth of Aedesius, who had fixed at Pergamus his wandering and persecuted
      school. But as the declining strength of that venerable sage was unequal
      to the ardor, the diligence, the rapid conception of his pupil, two of his
      most learned disciples, Chrysanthes and Eusebius, supplied, at his own
      desire, the place of their aged master. These philosophers seem to have
      prepared and distributed their respective parts; and they artfully
      contrived, by dark hints and affected disputes, to excite the impatient
      hopes of the aspirant, till they delivered him into the hands of their
      associate, Maximus, the boldest and most skilful master of the Theurgic
      science. By his hands, Julian was secretly initiated at Ephesus, in the
      twentieth year of his age. His residence at Athens confirmed this
      unnatural alliance of philosophy and superstition.
    </p>
<p>
      He obtained the privilege of a solemn initiation into the mysteries of
      Eleusis, which, amidst the general decay of the Grecian worship, still
      retained some vestiges of their primaeval sanctity; and such was the zeal
      of Julian, that he afterwards invited the Eleusinian pontiff to the court
      of Gaul, for the sole purpose of consummating, by mystic rites and
      sacrifices, the great work of his sanctification. As these ceremonies were
      performed in the depth of caverns, and in the silence of the night, and as
      the inviolable secret of the mysteries was preserved by the discretion of
      the initiated, I shall not presume to describe the horrid sounds, and
      fiery apparitions, which were presented to the senses, or the imagination,
      of the credulous aspirant, <a href="#Blink23note-24" id="Blink23noteref-24" name="Blink23noteref-24">24</a> till the visions of comfort and knowledge
      broke upon him in a blaze of celestial light. <a href="#Blink23note-25" id="Blink23noteref-25" name="Blink23noteref-25">25</a> In the caverns of
      Ephesus and Eleusis, the mind of Julian was penetrated with sincere, deep,
      and unalterable enthusiasm; though he might sometimes exhibit the
      vicissitudes of pious fraud and hypocrisy, which may be observed, or at
      least suspected, in the characters of the most conscientious fanatics.
      From that moment he consecrated his life to the service of the gods; and
      while the occupations of war, of government, and of study, seemed to claim
      the whole measure of his time, a stated portion of the hours of the night
      was invariably reserved for the exercise of private devotion. The
      temperance which adorned the severe manners of the soldier and the
      philosopher was connected with some strict and frivolous rules of
      religious abstinence; and it was in honor of Pan or Mercury, of Hecate or
      Isis, that Julian, on particular days, denied himself the use of some
      particular food, which might have been offensive to his tutelar deities.
      By these voluntary fasts, he prepared his senses and his understanding for
      the frequent and familiar visits with which he was honored by the
      celestial powers. Notwithstanding the modest silence of Julian himself, we
      may learn from his faithful friend, the orator Libanius, that he lived in
      a perpetual intercourse with the gods and goddesses; that they descended
      upon earth to enjoy the conversation of their favorite hero; that they
      gently interrupted his slumbers by touching his hand or his hair; that
      they warned him of every impending danger, and conducted him, by their
      infallible wisdom, in every action of his life; and that he had acquired
      such an intimate knowledge of his heavenly guests, as readily to
      distinguish the voice of Jupiter from that of Minerva, and the form of
      Apollo from the figure of Hercules. <a href="#Blink23note-26" id="Blink23noteref-26" name="Blink23noteref-26">26</a> These sleeping or
      waking visions, the ordinary effects of abstinence and fanaticism, would
      almost degrade the emperor to the level of an Egyptian monk. But the
      useless lives of Antony or Pachomius were consumed in these vain
      occupations. Julian could break from the dream of superstition to arm
      himself for battle; and after vanquishing in the field the enemies of
      Rome, he calmly retired into his tent, to dictate the wise and salutary
      laws of an empire, or to indulge his genius in the elegant pursuits of
      literature and philosophy.

<p>
      The important secret of the apostasy of Julian was intrusted to the
      fidelity of the initiated, with whom he was united by the sacred ties of
      friendship and religion. <a href="#Blink23note-27" id="Blink23noteref-27" name="Blink23noteref-27">27</a> The pleasing rumor was cautiously circulated
      among the adherents of the ancient worship; and his future greatness
      became the object of the hopes, the prayers, and the predictions of the
      Pagans, in every province of the empire. From the zeal and virtues of
      their royal proselyte, they fondly expected the cure of every evil, and
      the restoration of every blessing; and instead of disapproving of the
      ardor of their pious wishes, Julian ingenuously confessed, that he was
      ambitious to attain a situation in which he might be useful to his country
      and to his religion. But this religion was viewed with a hostile eye by
      the successor of Constantine, whose capricious passions altercately saved
      and threatened the life of Julian. The arts of magic and divination were
      strictly prohibited under a despotic government, which condescended to
      fear them; and if the Pagans were reluctantly indulged in the exercise of
      their superstition, the rank of Julian would have excepted him from the
      general toleration. The apostate soon became the presumptive heir of the
      monarchy, and his death could alone have appeased the just apprehensions
      of the Christians. <a href="#Blink23note-28" id="Blink23noteref-28" name="Blink23noteref-28">28</a> But the young prince, who aspired to the
      glory of a hero rather than of a martyr, consulted his safety by
      dissembling his religion; and the easy temper of polytheism permitted him
      to join in the public worship of a sect which he inwardly despised.
      Libanius has considered the hypocrisy of his friend as a subject, not of
      censure, but of praise. "As the statues of the gods," says that orator,
      "which have been defiled with filth, are again placed in a magnificent
      temple, so the beauty of truth was seated in the mind of Julian, after it
      had been purified from the errors and follies of his education. His
      sentiments were changed; but as it would have been dangerous to have
      avowed his sentiments, his conduct still continued the same. Very
      different from the ass in Aesop, who disguised himself with a lion's hide,
      our lion was obliged to conceal himself under the skin of an ass; and,
      while he embraced the dictates of reason, to obey the laws of prudence and
      necessity." <a href="#Blink23note-29" id="Blink23noteref-29" name="Blink23noteref-29">29</a> The dissimulation of Julian lasted about ten
      years, from his secret initiation at Ephesus to the beginning of the civil
      war; when he declared himself at once the implacable enemy of Christ and
      of Constantius. This state of constraint might contribute to strengthen
      his devotion; and as soon as he had satisfied the obligation of assisting,
      on solemn festivals, at the assemblies of the Christians, Julian returned,
      with the impatience of a lover, to burn his free and voluntary incense on
      the domestic chapels of Jupiter and Mercury. But as every act of
      dissimulation must be painful to an ingenuous spirit, the profession of
      Christianity increased the aversion of Julian for a religion which
      oppressed the freedom of his mind, and compelled him to hold a conduct
      repugnant to the noblest attributes of human nature, sincerity and
      courage.

      The inclination of Julian might prefer the gods of Homer, and of the
      Scipios, to the new faith, which his uncle had established in the Roman
      empire; and in which he himself had been sanctified by the sacrament of
      baptism. But, as a philosopher, it was incumbent on him to justify his
      dissent from Christianity, which was supported by the number of its
      converts, by the chain of prophecy, the splendor of or miracles, and the
      weight of evidence. The elaborate work, <a href="#Blink23note-30" id="Blink23noteref-30" name="Blink23noteref-30">30</a> which he composed
      amidst the preparations of the Persian war, contained the substance of

      Christianity, the celebrated name of Porphyry was effaced by the superior
      merit or reputation of Julian. The minds of the faithful were either
      seduced, or scandalized, or alarmed; and the pagans, who sometimes
      presumed to engage in the unequal dispute, derived, from the popular work
      of their Imperial missionary, an inexhaustible supply of fallacious
      objections. But in the assiduous prosecution of these theological studies,
      the emperor of the Romans imbibed the illiberal prejudices and passions of
      a polemic divine. He contracted an irrevocable obligation to maintain and
      propagate his religious opinions; and whilst he secretly applauded the
      strength and dexterity with which he wielded the weapons of controversy,
      he was tempted to distrust the sincerity, or to despise the
      understandings, of his antagonists, who could obstinately resist the force
      of reason and eloquence.

      The Christians, who beheld with horror and indignation the apostasy of
      Julian, had much more to fear from his power than from his arguments. The
      pagans, who were conscious of his fervent zeal, expected, perhaps with
      impatience, that the flames of persecution should be immediately kindled
      against the enemies of the gods; and that the ingenious malice of Julian
      would invent some cruel refinements of death and torture which had been
      unknown to the rude and inexperienced fury of his predecessors. But the
      hopes, as well as the fears, of the religious factions were apparently
      disappointed, by the prudent humanity of a prince, <a href="#Blink23note-33" id="Blink23noteref-33" name="Blink23noteref-33">33</a> who was careful of
      his own fame, of the public peace, and of the rights of mankind.
      Instructed by history and reflection, Julian was persuaded, that if the
      diseases of the body may sometimes be cured by salutary violence, neither
      steel nor fire can eradicate the erroneous opinions of the mind. The
      reluctant victim may be dragged to the foot of the altar; but the heart
      still abhors and disclaims the sacrilegious act of the hand. Religious
      obstinacy is hardened and exasperated by oppression; and, as soon as the
      persecution subsides, those who have yielded are restored as penitents,
      and those who have resisted are honored as saints and martyrs. If Julian
      adopted the unsuccessful cruelty of Diocletian and his colleagues, he was
      sensible that he should stain his memory with the name of a tyrant, and
      add new glories to the Catholic church, which had derived strength and
      increase from the severity of the pagan magistrates. Actuated by these
      motives, and apprehensive of disturbing the repose of an unsettled reign,
      Julian surprised the world by an edict, which was not unworthy of a
      statesman, or a philosopher. He extended to all the inhabitants of the
      Roman world the benefits of a free and equal toleration; and the only
      hardship which he inflicted on the Christians, was to deprive them of the
      power of tormenting their fellow-subjects, whom they stigmatized with the
      odious titles of idolaters and heretics. The pagans received a gracious
      permission, or rather an express order, to open All their temples; <a href="#Blink23note-34" id="Blink23noteref-34" name="Blink23noteref-34">34</a>
      and they were at once delivered from the oppressive laws, and arbitrary
      vexations, which they had sustained under the reign of Constantine, and of
      his sons. At the same time the bishops and clergy, who had been banished
      by the Arian monarch, were recalled from exile, and restored to their
      respective churches; the Donatists, the Novatians, the Macedonians, the
      Eunomians, and those who, with a more prosperous fortune, adhered to the
      doctrine of the Council of Nice. Julian, who understood and derided their
      theological disputes, invited to the palace the leaders of the hostile
      sects, that he might enjoy the agreeable spectacle of their furious
      encounters. The clamor of controversy sometimes provoked the emperor to
      exclaim, "Hear me! the Franks have heard me, and the Alemanni;" but he
      soon discovered that he was now engaged with more obstinate and implacable
      enemies; and though he exerted the powers of oratory to persuade them to
      live in concord, or at least in peace, he was perfectly satisfied, before
      he dismissed them from his presence, that he had nothing to dread from the
      union of the Christians. The impartial Ammianus has ascribed this affected
      clemency to the desire of fomenting the intestine divisions of the church,
      and the insidious design of undermining the foundations of Christianity,
      was inseparably connected with the zeal which Julian professed, to restore
      the ancient religion of the empire. <a href="#Blink23note-35" id="Blink23noteref-35" name="Blink23noteref-35">35</a>

      As soon as he ascended the throne, he assumed, according to the custom of
      his predecessors, the character of supreme pontiff; not only as the most
      honorable title of Imperial greatness, but as a sacred and important
      office; the duties of which he was resolved to execute with pious
      diligence. As the business of the state prevented the emperor from joining
      every day in the public devotion of his subjects, he dedicated a domestic
      chapel to his tutelar deity the Sun; his gardens were filled with statues
      and altars of the gods; and each apartment of the palace displaced the
      appearance of a magnificent temple. Every morning he saluted the parent of
      light with a sacrifice; the blood of another victim was shed at the moment
      when the Sun sunk below the horizon; and the Moon, the Stars, and the
      Genii of the night received their respective and seasonable honors from
      the indefatigable devotion of Julian. On solemn festivals, he regularly
      visited the temple of the god or goddess to whom the day was peculiarly
      consecrated, and endeavored to excite the religion of the magistrates and
      people by the example of his own zeal. Instead of maintaining the lofty
      state of a monarch, distinguished by the splendor of his purple, and
      encompassed by the golden shields of his guards, Julian solicited, with
      respectful eagerness, the meanest offices which contributed to the worship
      of the gods. Amidst the sacred but licentious crowd of priests, of
      inferior ministers, and of female dancers, who were dedicated to the
      service of the temple, it was the business of the emperor to bring the
      wood, to blow the fire, to handle the knife, to slaughter the victim, and,
      thrusting his bloody hands into the bowels of the expiring animal, to draw
      forth the heart or liver, and to read, with the consummate skill of an
      haruspex, imaginary signs of future events. The wisest of the Pagans
      censured this extravagant superstition, which affected to despise the
      restraints of prudence and decency. Under the reign of a prince, who
      practised the rigid maxims of economy, the expense of religious worship
      consumed a very large portion of the revenue a constant supply of the
      scarcest and most beautiful birds was transported from distant climates,
      to bleed on the altars of the gods; a hundred oxen were frequently
      sacrificed by Julian on one and the same day; and it soon became a popular
      jest, that if he should return with conquest from the Persian war, the
      breed of horned cattle must infallibly be extinguished. Yet this expense
      may appear inconsiderable, when it is compared with the splendid presents
      which were offered either by the hand, or by order, of the emperor, to all
      the celebrated places of devotion in the Roman world; and with the sums
      allotted to repair and decorate the ancient temples, which had suffered
      the silent decay of time, or the recent injuries of Christian rapine.
      Encouraged by the example, the exhortations, the liberality, of their
      pious sovereign, the cities and families resumed the practice of their
      neglected ceremonies. "Every part of the world," exclaims Libanius, with
      devout transport, "displayed the triumph of religion; and the grateful
      prospect of flaming altars, bleeding victims, the smoke of incense, and a
      solemn train of priests and prophets, without fear and without danger. The
      sound of prayer and of music was heard on the tops of the highest
      mountains; and the same ox afforded a sacrifice for the gods, and a supper
      for their joyous votaries." <a href="#Blink23note-36" id="Blink23noteref-36" name="Blink23noteref-36">36</a>

      iv. p. 121.) These writers agree in the essential, and even minute, facts;
      but the different lights in which they view the extreme devotion of
      Julian, are expressive of the gradations of self-applause, passionate
      admiration, mild reproof, and partial invective.]
    </p>
<p>
      But the genius and power of Julian were unequal to the enterprise of
      restoring a religion which was destitute of theological principles, of
      moral precepts, and of ecclesiastical discipline; which rapidly hastened
      to decay and dissolution, and was not susceptible of any solid or
      consistent reformation. The jurisdiction of the supreme pontiff, more
      especially after that office had been united with the Imperial dignity,
      comprehended the whole extent of the Roman empire. Julian named for his
      vicars, in the several provinces, the priests and philosophers whom he
      esteemed the best qualified to cooperate in the execution of his great
      design; and his pastoral letters, <a href="#Blink23note-37" id="Blink23noteref-37" name="Blink23noteref-37">37</a> if we may use that
      name, still represent a very curious sketch of his wishes and intentions.
      He directs, that in every city the sacerdotal order should be composed,
      without any distinction of birth and fortune, of those persons who were
      the most conspicuous for the love of the gods, and of men. "If they are
      guilty," continues he, "of any scandalous offence, they should be censured
      or degraded by the superior pontiff; but as long as they retain their
      rank, they are entitled to the respect of the magistrates and people.
      Their humility may be shown in the plainness of their domestic garb; their
      dignity, in the pomp of holy vestments. When they are summoned in their
      turn to officiate before the altar, they ought not, during the appointed
      number of days, to depart from the precincts of the temple; nor should a
      single day be suffered to elapse, without the prayers and the sacrifice,
      which they are obliged to offer for the prosperity of the state, and of
      individuals. The exercise of their sacred functions requires an immaculate
      purity, both of mind and body; and even when they are dismissed from the
      temple to the occupations of common life, it is incumbent on them to excel
      in decency and virtue the rest of their fellow-citizens. The priest of the
      gods should never be seen in theatres or taverns. His conversation should
      be chaste, his diet temperate, his friends of honorable reputation; and if
      he sometimes visits the Forum or the Palace, he should appear only as the
      advocate of those who have vainly solicited either justice or mercy. His
      studies should be suited to the sanctity of his profession. Licentious
      tales, or comedies, or satires, must be banished from his library, which
      ought solely to consist of historical or philosophical writings; of
      history, which is founded in truth, and of philosophy, which is connected
      with religion. The impious opinions of the Epicureans and sceptics deserve
      his abhorrence and contempt; <a href="#Blink23note-38" id="Blink23noteref-38" name="Blink23noteref-38">38</a> but he should
      diligently study the systems of Pythagoras, of Plato, and of the Stoics,
      which unanimously teach that there are gods; that the world is governed by
      their providence; that their goodness is the source of every temporal
      blessing; and that they have prepared for the human soul a future state of
      reward or punishment." The Imperial pontiff inculcates, in the most
      persuasive language, the duties of benevolence and hospitality; exhorts
      his inferior clergy to recommend the universal practice of those virtues;
      promises to assist their indigence from the public treasury; and declares
      his resolution of establishing hospitals in every city, where the poor
      should be received without any invidious distinction of country or of
      religion. Julian beheld with envy the wise and humane regulations of the
      church; and he very frankly confesses his intention to deprive the
      Christians of the applause, as well as advantage, which they had acquired
      by the exclusive practice of charity and beneficence. <a href="#Blink23note-39" id="Blink23noteref-39" name="Blink23noteref-39">39</a>
      The same spirit of imitation might dispose the emperor to adopt several
      ecclesiastical institutions, the use and importance of which were approved
      by the success of his enemies. But if these imaginary plans of reformation
      had been realized, the forced and imperfect copy would have been less
      beneficial to Paganism, than honorable to Christianity. <a href="#Blink23note-40" id="Blink23noteref-40" name="Blink23noteref-40">40</a>
      The Gentiles, who peaceably followed the customs of their ancestors, were
      rather surprised than pleased with the introduction of foreign manners;
      and in the short period of his reign, Julian had frequent occasions to
      complain of the want of fervor of his own party. <a href="#Blink23note-41" id="Blink23noteref-41" name="Blink23noteref-41">41</a>

      The enthusiasm of Julian prompted him to embrace the friends of Jupiter as

      merit of Christian constancy, he admired and rewarded the noble
      perseverance of those Gentiles who had preferred the favor of the gods to

      the religion, of the Greeks, they acquired an additional claim to the
      friendship of Julian, who ranked the Muses in the number of his tutelar
      deities. In the religion which he had adopted, piety and learning were
      almost synonymous; <a href="#Blink23note-43" id="Blink23noteref-43" name="Blink23noteref-43">43</a> and a crowd of poets, of rhetoricians, and of
      philosophers, hastened to the Imperial court, to occupy the vacant places
      of the bishops, who had seduced the credulity of Constantius. His
      successor esteemed the ties of common initiation as far more sacred than
      those of consanguinity; he chose his favorites among the sages, who were
      deeply skilled in the occult sciences of magic and divination; and every
      impostor, who pretended to reveal the secrets of futurity, was assured of
      enjoying the present hour in honor and affluence. <a href="#Blink23note-44" id="Blink23noteref-44" name="Blink23noteref-44">44</a> Among the
      philosophers, Maximus obtained the most eminent rank in the friendship of
      his royal disciple, who communicated, with unreserved confidence, his
      actions, his sentiments, and his religious designs, during the anxious
      suspense of the civil war. <a href="#Blink23note-45" id="Blink23noteref-45" name="Blink23noteref-45">45</a> As soon as Julian had taken possession of the
      palace of Constantinople, he despatched an honorable and pressing
      invitation to Maximus, who then resided at Sardes in Lydia, with
      Chrysanthius, the associate of his art and studies. The prudent and
      superstitious Chrysanthius refused to undertake a journey which showed
      itself, according to the rules of divination, with the most threatening
      and malignant aspect: but his companion, whose fanaticism was of a bolder
      cast, persisted in his interrogations, till he had extorted from the gods
      a seeming consent to his own wishes, and those of the emperor. The journey
      of Maximus through the cities of Asia displayed the triumph of philosophic
      vanity; and the magistrates vied with each other in the honorable
      reception which they prepared for the friend of their sovereign. Julian
      was pronouncing an oration before the senate, when he was informed of the
      arrival of Maximus. The emperor immediately interrupted his discourse,
      advanced to meet him, and after a tender embrace, conducted him by the
      hand into the midst of the assembly; where he publicly acknowledged the
      benefits which he had derived from the instructions of the philosopher.
      Maximus, <a href="#Blink23note-46" id="Blink23noteref-46" name="Blink23noteref-46">46</a> who soon acquired the confidence, and
      influenced the councils of Julian, was insensibly corrupted by the
      temptations of a court. His dress became more splendid, his demeanor more
      lofty, and he was exposed, under a succeeding reign, to a disgraceful
      inquiry into the means by which the disciple of Plato had accumulated, in
      the short duration of his favor, a very scandalous proportion of wealth.
      Of the other philosophers and sophists, who were invited to the Imperial
      residence by the choice of Julian, or by the success of Maximus, few were
      able to preserve their innocence or their reputation. The liberal gifts of
      money, lands, and houses, were insufficient to satiate their rapacious
      avarice; and the indignation of the people was justly excited by the
      remembrance of their abject poverty and disinterested professions. The
      penetration of Julian could not always be deceived: but he was unwilling
      to despise the characters of those men whose talents deserved his esteem:
      he desired to escape the double reproach of imprudence and inconstancy;
      and he was apprehensive of degrading, in the eyes of the profane, the
      honor of letters and of religion. <a href="#Blink23note-47" id="Blink23noteref-47" name="Blink23noteref-47">47</a> <a href="#Blink23note-48" id="Blink23noteref-48" name="Blink23noteref-48">48</a>

<p>
      The favor of Julian was almost equally divided between the Pagans, who had
      firmly adhered to the worship of their ancestors, and the Christians, who
      prudently embraced the religion of their sovereign. The acquisition of new
      proselytes <a href="#Blink23note-49" id="Blink23noteref-49" name="Blink23noteref-49">49</a> gratified the ruling passions of his soul,
      superstition and vanity; and he was heard to declare, with the enthusiasm
      of a missionary, that if he could render each individual richer than
      Midas, and every city greater than Babylon, he should not esteem himself
      the benefactor of mankind, unless, at the same time, he could reclaim his
      subjects from their impious revolt against the immortal gods. <a href="#Blink23note-50" id="Blink23noteref-50" name="Blink23noteref-50">50</a>
      A prince who had studied human nature, and who possessed the treasures of
      the Roman empire, could adapt his arguments, his promises, and his
      rewards, to every order of Christians; <a href="#Blink23note-51" id="Blink23noteref-51" name="Blink23noteref-51">51</a> and the merit of a
      seasonable conversion was allowed to supply the defects of a candidate, or
      even to expiate the guilt of a criminal. As the army is the most forcible
      engine of absolute power, Julian applied himself, with peculiar diligence,
      to corrupt the religion of his troops, without whose hearty concurrence
      every measure must be dangerous and unsuccessful; and the natural temper
      of soldiers made this conquest as easy as it was important. The legions of
      Gaul devoted themselves to the faith, as well as to the fortunes, of their
      victorious leader; and even before the death of Constantius, he had the
      satisfaction of announcing to his friends, that they assisted with fervent
      devotion, and voracious appetite, at the sacrifices, which were repeatedly
      offered in his camp, of whole hecatombs of fat oxen. <a href="#Blink23note-52" id="Blink23noteref-52" name="Blink23noteref-52">52</a>
      The armies of the East, which had been trained under the standard of the
      cross, and of Constantius, required a more artful and expensive mode of
      persuasion. On the days of solemn and public festivals, the emperor
      received the homage, and rewarded the merit, of the troops. His throne of
      state was encircled with the military ensigns of Rome and the republic;
      the holy name of Christ was erased from the Labarum; and the symbols of
      war, of majesty, and of pagan superstition, were so dexterously blended,
      that the faithful subject incurred the guilt of idolatry, when he
      respectfully saluted the person or image of his sovereign. The soldiers
      passed successively in review; and each of them, before he received from
      the hand of Julian a liberal donative, proportioned to his rank and
      services, was required to cast a few grains of incense into the flame
      which burnt upon the altar. Some Christian confessors might resist, and
      others might repent; but the far greater number, allured by the prospect
      of gold, and awed by the presence of the emperor, contracted the criminal
      engagement; and their future perseverance in the worship of the gods was
      enforced by every consideration of duty and of interest.
    </p>
<p>
      By the frequent repetition of these arts, and at the expense of sums which
      would have purchased the service of half the nations of Scythia, Julian
      gradually acquired for his troops the imaginary protection of the gods,
      and for himself the firm and effectual support of the Roman legions. <a href="#Blink23note-53" id="Blink23noteref-53" name="Blink23noteref-53">53</a>
      It is indeed more than probable, that the restoration and encouragement of
      Paganism revealed a multitude of pretended Christians, who, from motives
      of temporal advantage, had acquiesced in the religion of the former reign;
      and who afterwards returned, with the same flexibility of conscience, to
      the faith which was professed by the successors of Julian.

      While the devout monarch incessantly labored to restore and propagate the
      religion of his ancestors, he embraced the extraordinary design of
      rebuilding the temple of Jerusalem. In a public epistle <a href="#Blink23note-54" id="Blink23noteref-54" name="Blink23noteref-54">54</a>
      to the nation or community of the Jews, dispersed through the provinces,
      he pities their misfortunes, condemns their oppressors, praises their
      constancy, declares himself their gracious protector, and expresses a
      pious hope, that after his return from the Persian war, he may be
      permitted to pay his grateful vows to the Almighty in his holy city of
      Jerusalem. The blind superstition, and abject slavery, of those
      unfortunate exiles, must excite the contempt of a philosophic emperor; but
      they deserved the friendship of Julian, by their implacable hatred of the
      Christian name. The barren synagogue abhorred and envied the fecundity of
      the rebellious church; the power of the Jews was not equal to their
      malice; but their gravest rabbis approved the private murder of an
      apostate; <a href="#Blink23note-55" id="Blink23noteref-55" name="Blink23noteref-55">55</a> and their seditious clamors had often
      awakened the indolence of the Pagan magistrates. Under the reign of
      Constantine, the Jews became the subjects of their revolted children nor
      was it long before they experienced the bitterness of domestic tyranny.
      The civil immunities which had been granted, or confirmed, by Severus,
      were gradually repealed by the Christian princes; and a rash tumult,
      excited by the Jews of Palestine, <a href="#Blink23note-56" id="Blink23noteref-56" name="Blink23noteref-56">56</a> seemed to justify the
      lucrative modes of oppression which were invented by the bishops and
      eunuchs of the court of Constantius. The Jewish patriarch, who was still
      permitted to exercise a precarious jurisdiction, held his residence at
      Tiberias; <a href="#Blink23note-57" id="Blink23noteref-57" name="Blink23noteref-57">57</a> and the neighboring cities of Palestine were
      filled with the remains of a people who fondly adhered to the promised
      land. But the edict of Hadrian was renewed and enforced; and they viewed
      from afar the walls of the holy city, which were profaned in their eyes by
      the triumph of the cross and the devotion of the Christians. <a href="#Blink23note-58" id="Blink23noteref-58" name="Blink23noteref-58">58</a>

      north side, the buildings of the lower town covered the spacious summit of
      Mount Acra; and a part of the hill, distinguished by the name of Moriah,
      and levelled by human industry, was crowned with the stately temple of the
      Jewish nation. After the final destruction of the temple by the arms of
      Titus and Hadrian, a ploughshare was drawn over the consecrated ground, as
      a sign of perpetual interdiction. Sion was deserted; and the vacant space
      of the lower city was filled with the public and private edifices of the
      Aelian colony, which spread themselves over the adjacent hill of Calvary.
      The holy places were polluted with mountains of idolatry; and, either from
      design or accident, a chapel was dedicated to Venus, on the spot which had

      The passionate desire of contemplating the original monuments of their
      redemption attracted to Jerusalem a successive crowd of pilgrims, from the
      shores of the Atlantic Ocean, and the most distant countries of the East;
      <a href="#Blink23note-63" id="Blink23noteref-63" name="Blink23noteref-63">63</a>
      and their piety was authorized by the example of the empress Helena, who
      appears to have united the credulity of age with the warm feelings of a
      recent conversion. Sages and heroes, who have visited the memorable scenes
      of ancient wisdom or glory, have confessed the inspiration of the genius
      of the place; <a href="#Blink23note-64" id="Blink23noteref-64" name="Blink23noteref-64">64</a> and the Christian who knelt before the holy
      sepulchre, ascribed his lively faith, and his fervent devotion, to the
      more immediate influence of the Divine Spirit. The zeal, perhaps the
      avarice, of the clergy of Jerusalem, cherished and multiplied these
      beneficial visits. They fixed, by unquestionable tradition, the scene of
      each memorable event. They exhibited the instruments which had been used
      in the passion of Christ; the nails and the lance that had pierced his
      hands, his feet, and his side; the crown of thorns that was planted on his
      head; the pillar at which he was scourged; and, above all, they showed the
      cross on which he suffered, and which was dug out of the earth in the
      reign of those princes, who inserted the symbol of Christianity in the
      banners of the Roman legions. <a href="#Blink23note-65" id="Blink23noteref-65" name="Blink23noteref-65">65</a> Such miracles as
      seemed necessary to account for its extraordinary preservation, and
      seasonable discovery, were gradually propagated without opposition. The
      custody of the true cross, which on Easter Sunday was solemnly exposed to
      the people, was intrusted to the bishop of Jerusalem; and he alone might
      gratify the curious devotion of the pilgrims, by the gift of small pieces,
      which they encased in gold or gems, and carried away in triumph to their
      respective countries. But as this gainful branch of commerce must soon
      have been annihilated, it was found convenient to suppose, that the
      marvelous wood possessed a secret power of vegetation; and that its
      substance, though continually diminished, still remained entire and
      unimpaired. <a href="#Blink23note-66" id="Blink23noteref-66" name="Blink23noteref-66">66</a> It might perhaps have been expected, that the
      influence of the place and the belief of a perpetual miracle, should have
      produced some salutary effects on the morals, as well as on the faith, of
      the people. Yet the most respectable of the ecclesiastical writers have
      been obliged to confess, not only that the streets of Jerusalem were
      filled with the incessant tumult of business and pleasure, <a href="#Blink23note-67" id="Blink23noteref-67" name="Blink23noteref-67">67</a>
      but that every species of vice—adultery, theft, idolatry, poisoning,

      were firmly persuaded that a sentence of everlasting destruction had been

      and such was the appetite of Julian for bloody sacrifice, that his
      emulation might be excited by the piety of Solomon, who had offered, at
      the feast of the dedication, twenty-two thousand oxen, and one hundred and
      twenty thousand sheep. <a href="#Blink23note-74" id="Blink23noteref-74" name="Blink23noteref-74">74</a> These considerations might influence his
      designs; but the prospect of an immediate and important advantage would
      not suffer the impatient monarch to expect the remote and uncertain event
      of the Persian war. He resolved to erect, without delay, on the commanding
      eminence of Moriah, a stately temple, which might eclipse the splendor of
      the church of the resurrection on the adjacent hill of Calvary; to
      establish an order of priests, whose interested zeal would detect the
      arts, and resist the ambition, of their Christian rivals; and to invite a
      numerous colony of Jews, whose stern fanaticism would be always prepared
      to second, and even to anticipate, the hostile measures of the Pagan
      government. Among the friends of the emperor (if the names of emperor, and
      of friend, are not incompatible) the first place was assigned, by Julian
      himself, to the virtuous and learned Alypius. <a href="#Blink23note-75" id="Blink23noteref-75" name="Blink23noteref-75">75</a> The humanity of
      Alypius was tempered by severe justice and manly fortitude; and while he
      exercised his abilities in the civil administration of Britain, he
      imitated, in his poetical compositions, the harmony and softness of the
      odes of Sappho. This minister, to whom Julian communicated, without
      reserve, his most careless levities, and his most serious counsels,
      received an extraordinary commission to restore, in its pristine beauty,

      assembled on the holy mountain of their fathers; and their insolent

      transported in mantles of silk and purple. Every purse was opened in
      liberal contributions, every hand claimed a share in the pious labor, and
      the commands of a great monarch were executed by the enthusiasm of a whole
      people. <a href="#Blink23note-76" id="Blink23noteref-76" name="Blink23noteref-76">76</a>

      Yet, on this occasion, the joint efforts of power and enthusiasm were

      months of the life of Julian. <a href="#Blink23note-78" id="Blink23noteref-78" name="Blink23noteref-78">78</a> But the Christians
      entertained a natural and pious expectation, that, in this memorable
      contest, the honor of religion would be vindicated by some signal miracle.
      An earthquake, a whirlwind, and a fiery eruption, which overturned and
      scattered the new foundations of the temple, are attested, with some
      variations, by contemporary and respectable evidence. <a href="#Blink23note-79" id="Blink23noteref-79" name="Blink23noteref-79">79</a>

      an epistle to the emperor Theodosius, which must provoke the severe

      account of the miracle before the expiration of the same year. The last of
      these writers has boldly declared, that this preternatural event was not
      disputed by the infidels; and his assertion, strange as it may seem is
      confirmed by the unexceptionable testimony of Ammianus Marcellinus. <a href="#Blink23note-83" id="Blink23noteref-83" name="Blink23noteref-83">83</a>
      The philosophic soldier, who loved the virtues, without adopting the
      prejudices, of his master, has recorded, in his judicious and candid
      history of his own times, the extraordinary obstacles which interrupted
      the restoration of the temple of Jerusalem. "Whilst Alypius, assisted by
      the governor of the province, urged, with vigor and diligence, the
      execution of the work, horrible balls of fire breaking out near the
      foundations, with frequent and reiterated attacks, rendered the place,
      from time to time, inaccessible to the scorched and blasted workmen; and
      the victorious element continuing in this manner obstinately and
      resolutely bent, as it were, to drive them to a distance, the undertaking
      was abandoned." <a href="#Blink23note-8311" id="Blink23noteref-8311" name="Blink23noteref-8311">8311</a> Such authority should satisfy a
      believing, and must astonish an incredulous, mind. Yet a philosopher may
      still require the original evidence of impartial and intelligent
      spectators. At this important crisis, any singular accident of nature
      would assume the appearance, and produce the effects of a real prodigy.
      This glorious deliverance would be speedily improved and magnified by the
      pious art of the clergy of Jerusalem, and the active credulity of the
      Christian world and, at the distance of twenty years, a Roman historian,
      care less of theological disputes, might adorn his work with the specious

      an ingenious and sufficiently probable explanation of this remarkable
      incident, which the positive testimony of Ammianus, a contemporary and a
      pagan, will not permit us to call in question. It was suggested by a
      passage in Tacitus. That historian, speaking of Jerusalem, says, [I omit
      the first part of the quotation adduced by M. Guizot, which only by a most
      extraordinary mistranslation of muri introrsus sinuati by "enfoncemens"
      could be made to bear on the question.—M.] The Temple itself was a
      kind of citadel, which had its own walls, superior in their workmanship
      and construction to those of the city. The porticos themselves, which
      surrounded the temple, were an excellent fortification. There was a
      fountain of constantly running water; subterranean excavations under the
      mountain; reservoirs and cisterns to collect the rain-water. Tac. Hist. v.
      ii. 12. These excavations and reservoirs must have been very considerable.
      The latter furnished water during the whole siege of Jerusalem to
      1,100,000 inhabitants, for whom the fountain of Siloe could not have
      sufficed, and who had no fresh rain-water, the siege having taken place
      from the month of April to the month of August, a period of the year
      during which it rarely rains in Jerusalem. As to the excavations, they
      served after, and even before, the return of the Jews from Babylon, to
      contain not only magazines of oil, wine, and corn, but also the treasures
      which were laid up in the Temple. Josephus has related several incidents
      which show their extent. When Jerusalem was on the point of being taken by
      Titus, the rebel chiefs, placing their last hopes in these vast
      subterranean cavities, formed a design of concealing themselves there, and
      remaining during the conflagration of the city, and until the Romans had
      retired to a distance. The greater part had not time to execute their
      design; but one of them, Simon, the Son of Gioras, having provided himself
      with food, and tools to excavate the earth descended into this retreat
      with some companions: he remained there till Titus had set out for Rome:
      under the pressure of famine he issued forth on a sudden in the very place
      where the Temple had stood, and appeared in the midst of the Roman guard.
      He was seized and carried to Rome for the triumph. His appearance made it
      be suspected that other Jews might have chosen the same asylum; search was
      made, and a great number discovered. Joseph. de Bell. Jud. l. vii. c. 2.
      It is probable that the greater part of these excavations were the remains
      of the time of Solomon, when it was the custom to work to a great extent
      under ground: no other date can be assigned to them. The Jews, on their
      return from the captivity, were too poor to undertake such works; and,
      although Herod, on rebuilding the Temple, made some excavations, (Joseph.
      Ant. Jud. xv. 11, vii.,) the haste with which that building was completed
      will not allow us to suppose that they belonged to that period. Some were
      used for sewers and drains, others served to conceal the immense treasures
      of which Crassus, a hundred and twenty years before, plundered the Jews,
      and which doubtless had been since replaced. The Temple was destroyed A.
      C. 70; the attempt of Julian to rebuild it, and the fact related by
      Ammianus, coincide with the year 363. There had then elapsed between these
      two epochs an interval of near 300 years, during which the excavations,
      choked up with ruins, must have become full of inflammable air. The
      workmen employed by Julian as they were digging, arrived at the
      excavations of the Temple; they would take torches to explore them; sudden
      flames repelled those who approached; explosions were heard, and these
      phenomena were renewed every time that they penetrated into new
      subterranean passages. This explanation is confirmed by the relation of an
      event nearly similar, by Josephus. King Herod having heard that immense
      treasures had been concealed in the sepulchre of David, he descended into
      it with a few confidential persons; he found in the first subterranean
      chamber only jewels and precious stuffs: but having wished to penetrate
      into a second chamber, which had been long closed, he was repelled, when
      he opened it, by flames which killed those who accompanied him. (Ant. Jud.
      xvi. 7, i.) As here there is no room for miracle, this fact may be
      considered as a new proof of the veracity of that related by Ammianus and
      the contemporary writers.—G. ——To the illustrations of
      the extent of the subterranean chambers adduced by Michaelis, may be
      added, that when John of Gischala, during the siege, surprised the Temple,
      the party of Eleazar took refuge within them. Bell. Jud. vi. 3, i. The
      sudden sinking of the hill of Sion when Jerusalem was occupied by
      Barchocab, may have been connected with similar excavations. Hist. of
      Jews, vol. iii. 122 and 186.—M. ——It is a fact now
      popularly known, that when mines which have been long closed are opened,
      one of two things takes place; either the torches are extinguished and the
      men fall first into a swoor and soon die; or, if the air is inflammable, a
      little flame is seen to flicker round the lamp, which spreads and
      multiplies till the conflagration becomes general, is followed by an
      explosion, and kill all who are in the way.—G.]

      The restoration of the Jewish temple was secretly connected with the ruin
      of the Christian church. Julian still continued to maintain the freedom of
      religious worship, without distinguishing whether this universal
      toleration proceeded from his justice or his clemency. He affected to pity
      the unhappy Christians, who were mistaken in the most important object of
      their lives; but his pity was degraded by contempt, his contempt was
      embittered by hatred; and the sentiments of Julian were expressed in a
      style of sarcastic wit, which inflicts a deep and deadly wound, whenever
      it issues from the mouth of a sovereign. As he was sensible that the
      Christians gloried in the name of their Redeemer, he countenanced, and
      perhaps enjoined, the use of the less honorable appellation of Galilaeans.
      <a href="#Blink23note-85" id="Blink23noteref-85" name="Blink23noteref-85">85</a>
      He declared, that by the folly of the Galilaeans, whom he describes as a
      sect of fanatics, contemptible to men, and odious to the gods, the empire
      had been reduced to the brink of destruction; and he insinuates in a
      public edict, that a frantic patient might sometimes be cured by salutary
      violence. <a href="#Blink23note-86" id="Blink23noteref-86" name="Blink23noteref-86">86</a> An ungenerous distinction was admitted into
      the mind and counsels of Julian, that, according to the difference of
      their religious sentiments, one part of his subjects deserved his favor
      and friendship, while the other was entitled only to the common benefits
      that his justice could not refuse to an obedient people. According to a
      principle, pregnant with mischief and oppression, the emperor transferred
      to the pontiffs of his own religion the management of the liberal
      allowances for the public revenue, which had been granted to the church by
      the piety of Constantine and his sons. The proud system of clerical honors
      and immunities, which had been constructed with so much art and labor, was
      levelled to the ground; the hopes of testamentary donations were
      intercepted by the rigor of the laws; and the priests of the Christian
      sect were confounded with the last and most ignominious class of the
      people. Such of these regulations as appeared necessary to check the
      ambition and avarice of the ecclesiastics, were soon afterwards imitated
      by the wisdom of an orthodox prince. The peculiar distinctions which
      policy has bestowed, or superstition has lavished, on the sacerdotal
      order, must be confined to those priests who profess the religion of the
      state. But the will of the legislator was not exempt from prejudice and
      passion; and it was the object of the insidious policy of Julian, to
      deprive the Christians of all the temporal honors and advantages which
      rendered them respectable in the eyes of the world. <a href="#Blink23note-88" id="Blink23noteref-88" name="Blink23noteref-88">88</a>

      The motives alleged by the emperor to justify this partial and oppressive
      measure, might command, during his lifetime, the silence of slaves and the
      applause of Gatterers. Julian abuses the ambiguous meaning of a word which
      might be indifferently applied to the language and the religion of the
      Greeks: he contemptuously observes, that the men who exalt the merit of
      implicit faith are unfit to claim or to enjoy the advantages of science;
      and he vainly contends, that if they refuse to adore the gods of Homer and

      resort with freedom to the public schools, in a just confidence, that
      their tender minds would receive the impressions of literature and
      idolatry. If the greatest part of the Christian youth should be deterred
      by their own scruples, or by those of their parents, from accepting this
      dangerous mode of instruction, they must, at the same time, relinquish the
      benefits of a liberal education. Julian had reason to expect that, in the
      space of a few years, the church would relapse into its primaeval
      simplicity, and that the theologians, who possessed an adequate share of
      the learning and eloquence of the age, would be succeeded by a generation
      of blind and ignorant fanatics, incapable of defending the truth of their

<p>
      It was undoubtedly the wish and design of Julian to deprive the Christians
      of the advantages of wealth, of knowledge, and of power; but the injustice
      of excluding them from all offices of trust and profit seems to have been
      the result of his general policy, rather than the immediate consequence of
      any positive law. <a href="#Blink23note-94" id="Blink23noteref-94" name="Blink23noteref-94">94</a> Superior merit might deserve and obtain, some
      extraordinary exceptions; but the greater part of the Christian officers
      were gradually removed from their employments in the state, the army, and
      the provinces. The hopes of future candidates were extinguished by the
      declared partiality of a prince, who maliciously reminded them, that it
      was unlawful for a Christian to use the sword, either of justice, or of
      war; and who studiously guarded the camp and the tribunals with the
      ensigns of idolatry. The powers of government were intrusted to the
      pagans, who professed an ardent zeal for the religion of their ancestors;
      and as the choice of the emperor was often directed by the rules of
      divination, the favorites whom he preferred as the most agreeable to the
      gods, did not always obtain the approbation of mankind. <a href="#Blink23note-95" id="Blink23noteref-95" name="Blink23noteref-95">95</a>
      Under the administration of their enemies, the Christians had much to
      suffer, and more to apprehend. The temper of Julian was averse to cruelty;
      and the care of his reputation, which was exposed to the eyes of the
      universe, restrained the philosophic monarch from violating the laws of
      justice and toleration, which he himself had so recently established. But
      the provincial ministers of his authority were placed in a less
      conspicuous station. In the exercise of arbitrary power, they consulted
      the wishes, rather than the commands, of their sovereign; and ventured to
      exercise a secret and vexatious tyranny against the sectaries, on whom
      they were not permitted to confer the honors of martyrdom. The emperor,
      who dissembled as long as possible his knowledge of the injustice that was
      exercised in his name, expressed his real sense of the conduct of his
      officers, by gentle reproofs and substantial rewards. <a href="#Blink23note-96" id="Blink23noteref-96" name="Blink23noteref-96">96</a>

    </p>
<p>
      The most effectual instrument of oppression, with which they were armed,
      was the law that obliged the Christians to make full and ample
      satisfaction for the temples which they had destroyed under the preceding
      reign. The zeal of the triumphant church had not always expected the
      sanction of the public authority; and the bishops, who were secure of
      impunity, had often marched at the head of their congregation, to attack
      and demolish the fortresses of the prince of darkness. The consecrated
      lands, which had increased the patrimony of the sovereign or of the
      clergy, were clearly defined, and easily restored. But on these lands, and
      on the ruins of Pagan superstition, the Christians had frequently erected
      their own religious edifices: and as it was necessary to remove the church
      before the temple could be rebuilt, the justice and piety of the emperor
      were applauded by one party, while the other deplored and execrated his
      sacrilegious violence. <a href="#Blink23note-97" id="Blink23noteref-97" name="Blink23noteref-97">97</a> After the ground was cleared, the restitution
      of those stately structures which had been levelled with the dust, and of
      the precious ornaments which had been converted to Christian uses, swelled
      into a very large account of damages and debt. The authors of the injury
      had neither the ability nor the inclination to discharge this accumulated
      demand: and the impartial wisdom of a legislator would have been displayed
      in balancing the adverse claims and complaints, by an equitable and
      temperate arbitration.
    </p>
<p>
      But the whole empire, and particularly the East, was thrown into confusion
      by the rash edicts of Julian; and the Pagan magistrates, inflamed by zeal
      and revenge, abused the rigorous privilege of the Roman law, which
      substitutes, in the place of his inadequate property, the person of the
      insolvent debtor. Under the preceding reign, Mark, bishop of Arethusa, <a href="#Blink23note-98" id="Blink23noteref-98" name="Blink23noteref-98">98</a>
      had labored in the conversion of his people with arms more effectual than
      those of persuasion. <a href="#Blink23note-99" id="Blink23noteref-99" name="Blink23noteref-99">99</a> The magistrates required the full value of a
      temple which had been destroyed by his intolerant zeal: but as they were
      satisfied of his poverty, they desired only to bend his inflexible spirit
      to the promise of the slightest compensation. They apprehended the aged
      prelate, they inhumanly scourged him, they tore his beard; and his naked
      body, annointed with honey, was suspended, in a net, between heaven and
      earth, and exposed to the stings of insects and the rays of a Syrian sun.
      <a href="#Blink23note-100" id="Blink23noteref-100" name="Blink23noteref-100">100</a>
      From this lofty station, Mark still persisted to glory in his crime, and
      to insult the impotent rage of his persecutors. He was at length rescued
      from their hands, and dismissed to enjoy the honor of his divine triumph.
      The Arians celebrated the virtue of their pious confessor; the Catholics
      ambitiously claimed his alliance; <a href="#Blink23note-101" id="Blink23noteref-101" name="Blink23noteref-101">101</a> and the Pagans,
      who might be susceptible of shame or remorse, were deterred from the
      repetition of such unavailing cruelty. <a href="#Blink23note-102" id="Blink23noteref-102" name="Blink23noteref-102">102</a> Julian spared his

      At the distance of five miles from Antioch, the Macedonian kings of Syria
      had consecrated to Apollo one of the most elegant places of devotion in
      the Pagan world. <a href="#Blink23note-104" id="Blink23noteref-104" name="Blink23noteref-104">104</a> A magnificent temple rose in honor of the
      god of light; and his colossal figure <a href="#Blink23note-105" id="Blink23noteref-105" name="Blink23noteref-105">105</a> almost filled the
      capacious sanctuary, which was enriched with gold and gems, and adorned by
      the skill of the Grecian artists. The deity was represented in a bending
      attitude, with a golden cup in his hand, pouring out a libation on the
      earth; as if he supplicated the venerable mother to give to his arms the
      cold and beauteous Daphne: for the spot was ennobled by fiction; and the
      fancy of the Syrian poets had transported the amorous tale from the banks
      of the Peneus to those of the Orontes. The ancient rites of Greece were
      imitated by the royal colony of Antioch. A stream of prophecy, which
      rivalled the truth and reputation of the Delphic oracle, flowed from the
      Castalian fountain of Daphne. <a href="#Blink23note-106" id="Blink23noteref-106" name="Blink23noteref-106">106</a> In the adjacent

      which had been purchased from Elis; the Olympic games were celebrated at

      was annually applied to the public pleasures. <a href="#Blink23note-108" id="Blink23noteref-108" name="Blink23noteref-108">108</a> The perpetual
      resort of pilgrims and spectators insensibly formed, in the neighborhood
      of the temple, the stately and populous village of Daphne, which emulated
      the splendor, without acquiring the title, of a provincial city. The
      temple and the village were deeply bosomed in a thick grove of laurels and
      cypresses, which reached as far as a circumference of ten miles, and
      formed in the most sultry summers a cool and impenetrable shade. A
      thousand streams of the purest water, issuing from every hill, preserved
      the verdure of the earth, and the temperature of the air; the senses were
      gratified with harmonious sounds and aromatic odors; and the peaceful
      grove was consecrated to health and joy, to luxury and love. The vigorous
      youth pursued, like Apollo, the object of his desires; and the blushing
      maid was warned, by the fate of Daphne, to shun the folly of unseasonable
      coyness. The soldier and the philosopher wisely avoided the temptation of
      this sensual paradise: <a href="#Blink23note-109" id="Blink23noteref-109" name="Blink23noteref-109">109</a> where pleasure, assuming the character of
      religion, imperceptibly dissolved the firmness of manly virtue. But the
      groves of Daphne continued for many ages to enjoy the veneration of
      natives and strangers; the privileges of the holy ground were enlarged by
      the munificence of succeeding emperors; and every generation added new
      ornaments to the splendor of the temple. <a href="#Blink23note-110" id="Blink23noteref-110" name="Blink23noteref-110">110</a>

      When Julian, on the day of the annual festival, hastened to adore the
      Apollo of Daphne, his devotion was raised to the highest pitch of
      eagerness and impatience. His lively imagination anticipated the grateful
      pomp of victims, of libations and of incense; a long procession of youths
      and virgins, clothed in white robes, the symbol of their innocence; and
      the tumultuous concourse of an innumerable people. But the zeal of Antioch
      was diverted, since the reign of Christianity, into a different channel.
      Instead of hecatombs of fat oxen sacrificed by the tribes of a wealthy
      city to their tutelar deity the emperor complains that he found only a
      single goose, provided at the expense of a priest, the pale and solitary
      in habitant of this decayed temple. <a href="#Blink23note-111" id="Blink23noteref-111" name="Blink23noteref-111">111</a> The altar was

      Babylas <a href="#Blink23note-112" id="Blink23noteref-112" name="Blink23noteref-112">112</a> (a bishop of Antioch, who died in prison in
      the persecution of Decius) had rested near a century in his grave, his
      body, by the order of Caesar Gallus, was transported into the midst of the
      grove of Daphne. A magnificent church was erected over his remains; a
      portion of the sacred lands was usurped for the maintenance of the clergy,
      and for the burial of the Christians at Antioch, who were ambitious of
      lying at the feet of their bishop; and the priests of Apollo retired, with
      their affrighted and indignant votaries. As soon as another revolution
      seemed to restore the fortune of Paganism, the church of St. Babylas was
      demolished, and new buildings were added to the mouldering edifice which
      had been raised by the piety of Syrian kings. But the first and most
      serious care of Julian was to deliver his oppressed deity from the odious
      presence of the dead and living Christians, who had so effectually
      suppressed the voice of fraud or enthusiasm. <a href="#Blink23note-113" id="Blink23noteref-113" name="Blink23noteref-113">113</a> The scene of
      infection was purified, according to the forms of ancient rituals; the
      bodies were decently removed; and the ministers of the church were
      permitted to convey the remains of St. Babylas to their former habitation
      within the walls of Antioch. The modest behavior which might have assuaged
      the jealousy of a hostile government was neglected, on this occasion, by
      the zeal of the Christians. The lofty car, that transported the relics of
      Babylas, was followed, and accompanied, and received, by an innumerable
      multitude; who chanted, with thundering acclamations, the Psalms of David
      the most expressive of their contempt for idols and idolaters. The return
      of the saint was a triumph; and the triumph was an insult on the religion
      of the emperor, who exerted his pride to dissemble his resentment. During
      the night which terminated this indiscreet procession, the temple of
      Daphne was in flames; the statue of Apollo was consumed; and the walls of
      the edifice were left a naked and awful monument of ruin. The Christians
      of Antioch asserted, with religious confidence, that the powerful
      intercession of St. Babylas had pointed the lightnings of heaven against
      the devoted roof: but as Julian was reduced to the alternative of
      believing either a crime or a miracle, he chose, without hesitation,
      without evidence, but with some color of probability, to impute the fire
      of Daphne to the revenge of the Galilaeans. <a href="#Blink23note-114" id="Blink23noteref-114" name="Blink23noteref-114">114</a> Their offence, had
      it been sufficiently proved, might have justified the retaliation, which
      was immediately executed by the order of Julian, of shutting the doors,
      and confiscating the wealth, of the cathedral of Antioch. To discover the
      criminals who were guilty of the tumult, of the fire, or of secreting the
      riches of the church, several of the ecclesiastics were tortured; <a href="#Blink23note-115" id="Blink23noteref-115" name="Blink23noteref-115">115</a>
      and a Presbyter, of the name of Theodoret, was beheaded by the sentence of
      the Count of the East. But this hasty act was blamed by the emperor; who
      lamented, with real or affected concern, that the imprudent zeal of his
      ministers would tarnish his reign with the disgrace of persecution. <a href="#Blink23note-116" id="Blink23noteref-116" name="Blink23noteref-116">116</a>

      leader of a faction, the license of popular fury cannot easily be
      restrained, nor consistently punished. Julian, in a public composition,
      applauds the devotion and loyalty of the holy cities of Syria, whose pious
      inhabitants had destroyed, at the first signal, the sepulchres of the
      Galilaeans; and faintly complains, that they had revenged the injuries of

      moment of their prosperity. That the unhappy objects of their cruelty were
      released from torture only by death; and as their mangled bodies were
      dragged through the streets, they were pierced (such was the universal
      rage) by the spits of cooks, and the distaffs of enraged women; and that
      the entrails of Christian priests and virgins, after they had been tasted
      by those bloody fanatics, were mixed with barley, and contemptuously

      George, <a href="#Blink23note-119" id="Blink23noteref-119" name="Blink23noteref-119">119</a> from his parents or his education, surnamed
      the Cappadocian, was born at Epiphania in Cilicia, in a fuller's shop.
      From this obscure and servile origin he raised himself by the talents of a
      parasite; and the patrons, whom he assiduously flattered, procured for
      their worthless dependent a lucrative commission, or contract, to supply
      the army with bacon. His employment was mean; he rendered it infamous. He
      accumulated wealth by the basest arts of fraud and corruption; but his
      malversations were so notorious, that George was compelled to escape from
      the pursuits of justice. After this disgrace, in which he appears to have
      saved his fortune at the expense of his honor, he embraced, with real or
      affected zeal, the profession of Arianism. From the love, or the
      ostentation, of learning, he collected a valuable library of history
      rhetoric, philosophy, and theology, <a href="#Blink23note-120" id="Blink23noteref-120" name="Blink23noteref-120">120</a> and the choice of
      the prevailing faction promoted George of Cappadocia to the throne of
      Athanasius. The entrance of the new archbishop was that of a Barbarian
      conqueror; and each moment of his reign was polluted by cruelty and
      avarice. The Catholics of Alexandria and Egypt were abandoned to a tyrant,
      qualified, by nature and education, to exercise the office of persecution;
      but he oppressed with an impartial hand the various inhabitants of his
      extensive diocese. The primate of Egypt assumed the pomp and insolence of
      his lofty station; but he still betrayed the vices of his base and servile
      extraction. The merchants of Alexandria were impoverished by the unjust,
      and almost universal, monopoly, which he acquired, of nitre, salt, paper,
      funerals, &amp;c.: and the spiritual father of a great people condescended
      to practise the vile and pernicious arts of an informer. The Alexandrians
      could never forget, nor forgive, the tax, which he suggested, on all the
      houses of the city; under an obsolete claim, that the royal founder had
      conveyed to his successors, the Ptolemies and the Caesars, the perpetual
      property of the soil. The Pagans, who had been flattered with the hopes of
      freedom and toleration, excited his devout avarice; and the rich temples
      of Alexandria were either pillaged or insulted by the haughty prince, who
      exclaimed, in a loud and threatening tone, "How long will these sepulchres
      be permitted to stand?" Under the reign of Constantius, he was expelled by
      the fury, or rather by the justice, of the people; and it was not without
      a violent struggle, that the civil and military powers of the state could
      restore his authority, and gratify his revenge. The messenger who
      proclaimed at Alexandria the accession of Julian, announced the downfall
      of the archbishop. George, with two of his obsequious ministers, Count
      Diodorus, and Dracontius, master of the mint were ignominiously dragged in
      chains to the public prison. At the end of twenty-four days, the prison
      was forced open by the rage of a superstitious multitude, impatient of the
      tedious forms of judicial proceedings. The enemies of gods and men expired
      under their cruel insults; the lifeless bodies of the archbishop and his
      associates were carried in triumph through the streets on the back of a
      camel; <a href="#Blink23note-12011" id="Blink23noteref-12011" name="Blink23noteref-12011">12011</a> and the inactivity of the Athanasian
      party <a href="#Blink23note-121" id="Blink23noteref-121" name="Blink23noteref-121">121</a> was esteemed a shining example of
      evangelical patience. The remains of these guilty wretches were thrown
      into the sea; and the popular leaders of the tumult declared their
      resolution to disappoint the devotion of the Christians, and to intercept
      the future honors of these martyrs, who had been punished, like their
      predecessors, by the enemies of their religion. <a href="#Blink23note-122" id="Blink23noteref-122" name="Blink23noteref-122">122</a> The fears of the
      Pagans were just, and their precautions ineffectual. The meritorious death
      of the archbishop obliterated the memory of his life. The rival of
      Athanasius was dear and sacred to the Arians, and the seeming conversion
      of those sectaries introduced his worship into the bosom of the Catholic
      church. <a href="#Blink23note-123" id="Blink23noteref-123" name="Blink23noteref-123">123</a> The odious stranger, disguising every

      About the same time that Julian was informed of the tumult of Alexandria,
      he received intelligence from Edessa, that the proud and wealthy faction
      of the Arians had insulted the weakness of the Valentinians, and committed
      such disorders as ought not to be suffered with impunity in a
      well-regulated state. Without expecting the slow forms of justice, the
      exasperated prince directed his mandate to the magistrates of Edessa, <a href="#Blink23note-127" id="Blink23noteref-127" name="Blink23noteref-127">127</a>
      by which he confiscated the whole property of the church: the money was
      distributed among the soldiers; the lands were added to the domain; and
      this act of oppression was aggravated by the most ungenerous irony. "I
      show myself," says Julian, "the true friend of the Galilaeans. Their
      admirable law has promised the kingdom of heaven to the poor; and they
      will advance with more diligence in the paths of virtue and salvation,
      when they are relieved by my assistance from the load of temporal
      possessions. Take care," pursued the monarch, in a more serious tone,
      "take care how you provoke my patience and humanity. If these disorders
      continue, I will revenge on the magistrates the crimes of the people; and
      you will have reason to dread, not only confiscation and exile, but fire
      and the sword." The tumults of Alexandria were doubtless of a more bloody
      and dangerous nature: but a Christian bishop had fallen by the hands of
      the Pagans; and the public epistle of Julian affords a very lively proof
      of the partial spirit of his administration. His reproaches to the
      citizens of Alexandria are mingled with expressions of esteem and
      tenderness; and he laments, that, on this occasion, they should have
      departed from the gentle and generous manners which attested their Grecian
      extraction. He gravely censures the offence which they had committed
      against the laws of justice and humanity; but he recapitulates, with
      visible complacency, the intolerable provocations which they had so long
      endured from the impious tyranny of George of Cappadocia. Julian admits
      the principle, that a wise and vigorous government should chastise the
      insolence of the people; yet, in consideration of their founder Alexander,
      and of Serapis their tutelar deity, he grants a free and gracious pardon
      to the guilty city, for which he again feels the affection of a brother.

      After the tumult of Alexandria had subsided, Athanasius, amidst the public

      tempered with discretion, the exercise of his authority tended not to
      inflame, but to reconcile, the minds of the people. His pastoral labors
      were not confined to the narrow limits of Egypt. The state of the
      Christian world was present to his active and capacious mind; and the age,
      the merit, the reputation of Athanasius, enabled him to assume, in a
      moment of danger, the office of Ecclesiastical Dictator. <a href="#Blink23note-129" id="Blink23noteref-129" name="Blink23noteref-129">129</a>
      Three years were not yet elapsed since the majority of the bishops of the
      West had ignorantly, or reluctantly, subscribed the Confession of Rimini.
      They repented, they believed, but they dreaded the unseasonable rigor of
      their orthodox brethren; and if their pride was stronger than their faith,
      they might throw themselves into the arms of the Arians, to escape the
      indignity of a public penance, which must degrade them to the condition of
      obscure laymen. At the same time the domestic differences concerning the
      union and distinction of the divine persons, were agitated with some heat
      among the Catholic doctors; and the progress of this metaphysical
      controversy seemed to threaten a public and lasting division of the Greek
      and Latin churches. By the wisdom of a select synod, to which the name and
      presence of Athanasius gave the authority of a general council, the
      bishops, who had unwarily deviated into error, were admitted to the
      communion of the church, on the easy condition of subscribing the Nicene
      Creed; without any formal acknowledgment of their past fault, or any
      minute definition of their scholastic opinions. The advice of the primate
      of Egypt had already prepared the clergy of Gaul and Spain, of Italy and
      Greece, for the reception of this salutary measure; and, notwithstanding
      the opposition of some ardent spirits, <a href="#Blink23note-130" id="Blink23noteref-130" name="Blink23noteref-130">130</a> the fear of the
      common enemy promoted the peace and harmony of the Christians. <a href="#Blink23note-131" id="Blink23noteref-131" name="Blink23noteref-131">131</a>

<p>
      The skill and diligence of the primate of Egypt had improved the season of
      tranquillity, before it was interrupted by the hostile edicts of the
      emperor. <a href="#Blink23note-132" id="Blink23noteref-132" name="Blink23noteref-132">132</a> Julian, who despised the Christians,
      honored Athanasius with his sincere and peculiar hatred. For his sake
      alone, he introduced an arbitrary distinction, repugnant at least to the
      spirit of his former declarations. He maintained, that the Galilaeans,
      whom he had recalled from exile, were not restored, by that general
      indulgence, to the possession of their respective churches; and he
      expressed his astonishment, that a criminal, who had been repeatedly
      condemned by the judgment of the emperors, should dare to insult the
      majesty of the laws, and insolently usurp the archiepiscopal throne of
      Alexandria, without expecting the orders of his sovereign. As a punishment
      for the imaginary offence, he again banished Athanasius from the city; and
      he was pleased to suppose, that this act of justice would be highly
      agreeable to his pious subjects. The pressing solicitations of the people
      soon convinced him, that the majority of the Alexandrians were Christians;
      and that the greatest part of the Christians were firmly attached to the
      cause of their oppressed primate. But the knowledge of their sentiments,
      instead of persuading him to recall his decree, provoked him to extend to
      all Egypt the term of the exile of Athanasius. The zeal of the multitude
      rendered Julian still more inexorable: he was alarmed by the danger of
      leaving at the head of a tumultuous city, a daring and popular leader; and
      the language of his resentment discovers the opinion which he entertained
      of the courage and abilities of Athanasius. The execution of the sentence
      was still delayed, by the caution or negligence of Ecdicius, praefect of
      Egypt, who was at length awakened from his lethargy by a severe reprimand.
      "Though you neglect," says Julian, "to write to me on any other subject,
      at least it is your duty to inform me of your conduct towards Athanasius,
      the enemy of the gods. My intentions have been long since communicated to
      you. I swear by the great Serapis, that unless, on the calends of
      December, Athanasius has departed from Alexandria, nay, from Egypt, the
      officers of your government shall pay a fine of one hundred pounds of
      gold. You know my temper: I am slow to condemn, but I am still slower to
      forgive." This epistle was enforced by a short postscript, written with
      the emperor's own hand. "The contempt that is shown for all the gods fills
      me with grief and indignation. There is nothing that I should see, nothing
      that I should hear, with more pleasure, than the expulsion of Athanasius
      from all Egypt. The abominable wretch! Under my reign, the baptism of
      several Grecian ladies of the highest rank has been the effect of his
      persecutions." <a href="#Blink23note-133" id="Blink23noteref-133" name="Blink23noteref-133">133</a> The death of Athanasius was not expressly
      commanded; but the praefect of Egypt understood that it was safer for him
      to exceed, than to neglect, the orders of an irritated master. The
      archbishop prudently retired to the monasteries of the Desert; eluded,
      with his usual dexterity, the snares of the enemy; and lived to triumph
      over the ashes of a prince, who, in words of formidable import, had
      declared his wish that the whole venom of the Galilaean school were
      contained in the single person of Athanasius. <a href="#Blink23note-134" id="Blink23noteref-134" name="Blink23noteref-134">134</a> <a href="#Blink23note-13411" id="Blink23noteref-13411" name="Blink23noteref-13411">13411</a>

<p>
      I have endeavored faithfully to represent the artful system by which
      Julian proposed to obtain the effects, without incurring the guilt, or
      reproach, of persecution. But if the deadly spirit of fanaticism perverted
      the heart and understanding of a virtuous prince, it must, at the same
      time, be confessed that the real sufferings of the Christians were
      inflamed and magnified by human passions and religious enthusiasm. The
      meekness and resignation which had distinguished the primitive disciples
      of the gospel, was the object of the applause, rather than of the
      imitation of their successors. The Christians, who had now possessed above
      forty years the civil and ecclesiastical government of the empire, had
      contracted the insolent vices of prosperity, <a href="#Blink23note-135" id="Blink23noteref-135" name="Blink23noteref-135">135</a> and the habit of
      believing that the saints alone were entitled to reign over the earth. As
      soon as the enmity of Julian deprived the clergy of the privileges which
      had been conferred by the favor of Constantine, they complained of the
      most cruel oppression; and the free toleration of idolaters and heretics
      was a subject of grief and scandal to the orthodox party. <a href="#Blink23note-136" id="Blink23noteref-136" name="Blink23noteref-136">136</a>
      The acts of violence, which were no longer countenanced by the
      magistrates, were still committed by the zeal of the people. At Pessinus,
      the altar of Cybele was overturned almost in the presence of the emperor;
      and in the city of Caesarea in Cappadocia, the temple of Fortune, the sole
      place of worship which had been left to the Pagans, was destroyed by the
      rage of a popular tumult. On these occasions, a prince, who felt for the
      honor of the gods, was not disposed to interrupt the course of justice;
      and his mind was still more deeply exasperated, when he found that the
      fanatics, who had deserved and suffered the punishment of incendiaries,
      were rewarded with the honors of martyrdom. <a href="#Blink23note-137" id="Blink23noteref-137" name="Blink23noteref-137">137</a> The Christian
      subjects of Julian were assured of the hostile designs of their sovereign;
      and, to their jealous apprehension, every circumstance of his government
      might afford some grounds of discontent and suspicion. In the ordinary
      administration of the laws, the Christians, who formed so large a part of
      the people, must frequently be condemned: but their indulgent brethren,
      without examining the merits of the cause, presumed their innocence,
      allowed their claims, and imputed the severity of their judge to the
      partial malice of religious persecution. <a href="#Blink23note-138" id="Blink23noteref-138" name="Blink23noteref-138">138</a> These present
      hardships, intolerable as they might appear, were represented as a slight
      prelude of the impending calamities. The Christians considered Julian as a
      cruel and crafty tyrant; who suspended the execution of his revenge till
      he should return victorious from the Persian war. They expected, that as
      soon as he had triumphed over the foreign enemies of Rome, he would lay
      aside the irksome mask of dissimulation; that the amphitheatre would
      stream with the blood of hermits and bishops; and that the Christians who
      still persevered in the profession of the faith, would be deprived of the
      common benefits of nature and society. <a href="#Blink23note-139" id="Blink23noteref-139" name="Blink23noteref-139">139</a> Every calumny <a href="#Blink23note-140" id="Blink23noteref-140" name="Blink23noteref-140">140</a>
      that could wound the reputation of the Apostate, was credulously embraced
      by the fears and hatred of his adversaries; and their indiscreet clamors
      provoked the temper of a sovereign, whom it was their duty to respect, and
      their interest to flatter.
    </p>
<p>
      They still protested, that prayers and tears were their only weapons
      against the impious tyrant, whose head they devoted to the justice of
      offended Heaven. But they insinuated, with sullen resolution, that their
      submission was no longer the effect of weakness; and that, in the
      imperfect state of human virtue, the patience, which is founded on
      principle, may be exhausted by persecution. It is impossible to determine
      how far the zeal of Julian would have prevailed over his good sense and
      humanity; but if we seriously reflect on the strength and spirit of the
      church, we shall be convinced, that before the emperor could have
      extinguished the religion of Christ, he must have involved his country in
      the horrors of a civil war. <a href="#Blink23note-141" id="Blink23noteref-141" name="Blink23noteref-141">141</a>
