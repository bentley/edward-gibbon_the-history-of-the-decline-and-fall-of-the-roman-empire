<p>
      The philosophical fable which Julian composed under the name of the
      Caesars, <a href="#Blink24note-1" id="Blink24noteref-1" name="Blink24noteref-1">1</a> is one of the most agreeable and instructive
      productions of ancient wit. <a href="#Blink24note-2" id="Blink24noteref-2" name="Blink24noteref-2">2</a> During the freedom and equality of the days of
      the Saturnalia, Romulus prepared a feast for the deities of Olympus, who
      had adopted him as a worthy associate, and for the Roman princes, who had
      reigned over his martial people, and the vanquished nations of the earth.
      The immortals were placed in just order on their thrones of state, and the
      table of the Caesars was spread below the Moon in the upper region of the
      air. The tyrants, who would have disgraced the society of gods and men,
      were thrown headlong, by the inexorable Nemesis, into the Tartarean abyss.
      The rest of the Caesars successively advanced to their seats; and as they
      passed, the vices, the defects, the blemishes of their respective
      characters, were maliciously noticed by old Silenus, a laughing moralist,
      who disguised the wisdom of a philosopher under the mask of a Bacchanal.
      <a href="#Blink24note-3" id="Blink24noteref-3" name="Blink24noteref-3">3</a>
      As soon as the feast was ended, the voice of Mercury proclaimed the will
      of Jupiter, that a celestial crown should be the reward of superior merit.
      Julius Caesar, Augustus, Trajan, and Marcus Antoninus, were selected as
      the most illustrious candidates; the effeminate Constantine <a href="#Blink24note-4" id="Blink24noteref-4" name="Blink24noteref-4">4</a> was
      not excluded from this honorable competition, and the great Alexander was
      invited to dispute the prize of glory with the Roman heroes. Each of the
      candidates was allowed to display the merit of his own exploits; but, in
      the judgment of the gods, the modest silence of Marcus pleaded more
      powerfully than the elaborate orations of his haughty rivals. When the
      judges of this awful contest proceeded to examine the heart, and to
      scrutinize the springs of action, the superiority of the Imperial Stoic
      appeared still more decisive and conspicuous. <a href="#Blink24note-5" id="Blink24noteref-5" name="Blink24noteref-5">5</a> Alexander and Caesar,
      Augustus, Trajan, and Constantine, acknowledged, with a blush, that fame,
      or power, or pleasure had been the important object of their labors: but
      the gods themselves beheld, with reverence and love, a virtuous mortal,
      who had practised on the throne the lessons of philosophy; and who, in a
      state of human imperfection, had aspired to imitate the moral attributes
      of the Deity. The value of this agreeable composition (the Caesars of
      Julian) is enhanced by the rank of the author. A prince, who delineates,
      with freedom, the vices and virtues of his predecessors, subscribes, in
      every line, the censure or approbation of his own conduct.

      inclined to prefer a Greek to a Roman. But when he seriously compared a
      hero with a philosopher, he was sensible that mankind had much greater
      obligations to Socrates than to Alexander, (Orat. ad Themistium, p. 264.)]
    </p>
<p>
      In the cool moments of reflection, Julian preferred the useful and
      benevolent virtues of Antoninus; but his ambitious spirit was inflamed by
      the glory of Alexander; and he solicited, with equal ardor, the esteem of
      the wise, and the applause of the multitude. In the season of life when
      the powers of the mind and body enjoy the most active vigor, the emperor
      who was instructed by the experience, and animated by the success, of the
      German war, resolved to signalize his reign by some more splendid and
      memorable achievement. The ambassadors of the East, from the continent of
      India, and the Isle of Ceylon, <a href="#Blink24note-6" id="Blink24noteref-6" name="Blink24noteref-6">6</a> had respectfully saluted
      the Roman purple. <a href="#Blink24note-7" id="Blink24noteref-7" name="Blink24noteref-7">7</a> The nations of the West esteemed and dreaded
      the personal virtues of Julian, both in peace and war. He despised the
      trophies of a Gothic victory, and was satisfied that the rapacious
      Barbarians of the Danube would be restrained from any future violation of
      the faith of treaties by the terror of his name, and the additional
      fortifications with which he strengthened the Thracian and Illyrian
      frontiers. The successor of Cyrus and Artaxerxes was the only rival whom
      he deemed worthy of his arms; and he resolved, by the final conquest of
      Persia, to chastise the naughty nation which had so long resisted and
      insulted the majesty of Rome. <a href="#Blink24note-9" id="Blink24noteref-9" name="Blink24noteref-9">9</a> As soon as the Persian
      monarch was informed that the throne of Constantius was filed by a prince
      of a very different character, he condescended to make some artful, or
      perhaps sincere, overtures towards a negotiation of peace. But the pride
      of Sapor was astonished by the firmness of Julian; who sternly declared,
      that he would never consent to hold a peaceful conference among the flames
      and ruins of the cities of Mesopotamia; and who added, with a smile of
      contempt, that it was needless to treat by ambassadors, as he himself had
      determined to visit speedily the court of Persia. The impatience of the
      emperor urged the diligence of the military preparations. The generals
      were named; and Julian, marching from Constantinople through the provinces
      of Asia Minor, arrived at Antioch about eight months after the death of
      his predecessor. His ardent desire to march into the heart of Persia, was
      checked by the indispensable duty of regulating the state of the empire;
      by his zeal to revive the worship of the gods; and by the advice of his
      wisest friends; who represented the necessity of allowing the salutary
      interval of winter quarters, to restore the exhausted strength of the
      legions of Gaul, and the discipline and spirit of the Eastern troops.
      Julian was persuaded to fix, till the ensuing spring, his residence at
      Antioch, among a people maliciously disposed to deride the haste, and to
      censure the delays, of their sovereign. <a href="#Blink24note-10" id="Blink24noteref-10" name="Blink24noteref-10">10</a>

      If Julian had flattered himself, that his personal connection with the
      capital of the East would be productive of mutual satisfaction to the
      prince and people, he made a very false estimate of his own character, and
      of the manners of Antioch. <a href="#Blink24note-11" id="Blink24noteref-11" name="Blink24noteref-11">11</a> The warmth of the climate disposed the
      natives to the most intemperate enjoyment of tranquillity and opulence;
      and the lively licentiousness of the Greeks was blended with the
      hereditary softness of the Syrians. Fashion was the only law, pleasure the
      only pursuit, and the splendor of dress and furniture was the only
      distinction of the citizens of Antioch. The arts of luxury were honored;
      the serious and manly virtues were the subject of ridicule; and the
      contempt for female modesty and reverent age announced the universal
      corruption of the capital of the East. The love of spectacles was the
      taste, or rather passion, of the Syrians; the most skilful artists were
      procured from the adjacent cities; <a href="#Blink24note-12" id="Blink24noteref-12" name="Blink24noteref-12">12</a> a considerable share
      of the revenue was devoted to the public amusements; and the magnificence
      of the games of the theatre and circus was considered as the happiness and
      as the glory of Antioch. The rustic manners of a prince who disdained such
      glory, and was insensible of such happiness, soon disgusted the delicacy
      of his subjects; and the effeminate Orientals could neither imitate, nor
      admire, the severe simplicity which Julian always maintained, and
      sometimes affected. The days of festivity, consecrated, by ancient custom,
      to the honor of the gods, were the only occasions in which Julian relaxed
      his philosophic severity; and those festivals were the only days in which
      the Syrians of Antioch could reject the allurements of pleasure. The
      majority of the people supported the glory of the Christian name, which
      had been first invented by their ancestors: <a href="#Blink24note-13" id="Blink24noteref-13" name="Blink24noteref-13">13</a> they contended
      themselves with disobeying the moral precepts, but they were scrupulously
      attached to the speculative doctrines of their religion. The church of
      Antioch was distracted by heresy and schism; but the Arians and the
      Athanasians, the followers of Meletius and those of Paulinus, <a href="#Blink24note-14" id="Blink24noteref-14" name="Blink24noteref-14">14</a>
      were actuated by the same pious hatred of their common adversary.

      1701, &amp;c,) which henceforward I shall quote.]

<p>
      The strongest prejudice was entertained against the character of an
      apostate, the enemy and successor of a prince who had engaged the
      affections of a very numerous sect; and the removal of St. Babylas excited
      an implacable opposition to the person of Julian. His subjects complained,
      with superstitious indignation, that famine had pursued the emperor's
      steps from Constantinople to Antioch; and the discontent of a hungry
      people was exasperated by the injudicious attempt to relieve their
      distress. The inclemency of the season had affected the harvests of Syria;
      and the price of bread, <a href="#Blink24note-15" id="Blink24noteref-15" name="Blink24noteref-15">15</a> in the markets of Antioch, had naturally
      risen in proportion to the scarcity of corn. But the fair and reasonable
      proportion was soon violated by the rapacious arts of monopoly. In this
      unequal contest, in which the produce of the land is claimed by one party
      as his exclusive property, is used by another as a lucrative object of
      trade, and is required by a third for the daily and necessary support of
      life, all the profits of the intermediate agents are accumulated on the
      head of the defenceless customers. The hardships of their situation were
      exaggerated and increased by their own impatience and anxiety; and the
      apprehension of a scarcity gradually produced the appearances of a famine.
      When the luxurious citizens of Antioch complained of the high price of
      poultry and fish, Julian publicly declared, that a frugal city ought to be
      satisfied with a regular supply of wine, oil, and bread; but he
      acknowledged, that it was the duty of a sovereign to provide for the
      subsistence of his people. With this salutary view, the emperor ventured
      on a very dangerous and doubtful step, of fixing, by legal authority, the
      value of corn. He enacted, that, in a time of scarcity, it should be sold
      at a price which had seldom been known in the most plentiful years; and
      that his own example might strengthen his laws, he sent into the market
      four hundred and twenty-two thousand modii, or measures, which were drawn
      by his order from the granaries of Hierapolis, of Chalcis, and even of
      Egypt. The consequences might have been foreseen, and were soon felt. The
      Imperial wheat was purchased by the rich merchants; the proprietors of
      land, or of corn, withheld from the city the accustomed supply; and the
      small quantities that appeared in the market were secretly sold at an
      advanced and illegal price. Julian still continued to applaud his own
      policy, treated the complaints of the people as a vain and ungrateful
      murmur, and convinced Antioch that he had inherited the obstinacy, though
      not the cruelty, of his brother Gallus. <a href="#Blink24note-16" id="Blink24noteref-16" name="Blink24noteref-16">16</a> The remonstrances of
      the municipal senate served only to exasperate his inflexible mind. He was
      persuaded, perhaps with truth, that the senators of Antioch who possessed
      lands, or were concerned in trade, had themselves contributed to the
      calamities of their country; and he imputed the disrespectful boldness
      which they assumed, to the sense, not of public duty, but of private
      interest. The whole body, consisting of two hundred of the most noble and
      wealthy citizens, were sent, under a guard, from the palace to the prison;
      and though they were permitted, before the close of evening, to return to
      their respective houses, <a href="#Blink24note-17" id="Blink24noteref-17" name="Blink24noteref-17">17</a> the emperor himself could not obtain the
      forgiveness which he had so easily granted. The same grievances were still
      the subject of the same complaints, which were industriously circulated by
      the wit and levity of the Syrian Greeks. During the licentious days of the
      Saturnalia, the streets of the city resounded with insolent songs, which
      derided the laws, the religion, the personal conduct, and even the beard,
      of the emperor; the spirit of Antioch was manifested by the connivance of
      the magistrates, and the applause of the multitude. <a href="#Blink24note-18" id="Blink24noteref-18" name="Blink24noteref-18">18</a>
      The disciple of Socrates was too deeply affected by these popular insults;
      but the monarch, endowed with a quick sensibility, and possessed of
      absolute power, refused his passions the gratification of revenge. A
      tyrant might have proscribed, without distinction, the lives and fortunes
      of the citizens of Antioch; and the unwarlike Syrians must have patiently
      submitted to the lust, the rapaciousness and the cruelty, of the faithful
      legions of Gaul. A milder sentence might have deprived the capital of the
      East of its honors and privileges; and the courtiers, perhaps the
      subjects, of Julian, would have applauded an act of justice, which
      asserted the dignity of the supreme magistrate of the republic. <a href="#Blink24note-19" id="Blink24noteref-19" name="Blink24noteref-19">19</a>
      But instead of abusing, or exerting, the authority of the state, to
      revenge his personal injuries, Julian contented himself with an
      inoffensive mode of retaliation, which it would be in the power of few
      princes to employ. He had been insulted by satires and libels; in his
      turn, he composed, under the title of the Enemy of the Beard, an ironical
      confession of his own faults, and a severe satire on the licentious and
      effeminate manners of Antioch. This Imperial reply was publicly exposed
      before the gates of the palace; and the Misopogon <a href="#Blink24note-20" id="Blink24noteref-20" name="Blink24noteref-20">20</a> still remains a
      singular monument of the resentment, the wit, the humanity, and the
      indiscretion of Julian. Though he affected to laugh, he could not forgive.
      <a href="#Blink24note-21" id="Blink24noteref-21" name="Blink24noteref-21">21</a>
      His contempt was expressed, and his revenge might be gratified, by the
      nomination of a governor <a href="#Blink24note-22" id="Blink24noteref-22" name="Blink24noteref-22">22</a> worthy only of such subjects; and the
      emperor, forever renouncing the ungrateful city, proclaimed his resolution
      to pass the ensuing winter at Tarsus in Cilicia. <a href="#Blink24note-23" id="Blink24noteref-23" name="Blink24noteref-23">23</a>

      conclude, that under the successors of Constantine, the moderate price of
      wheat was about thirty-two shillings the English quarter, which is equal
      to the average price of the sixty-four first years of the present century.

<p>
      Yet Antioch possessed one citizen, whose genius and virtues might atone,
      in the opinion of Julian, for the vice and folly of his country. The
      sophist Libanius was born in the capital of the East; he publicly
      professed the arts of rhetoric and declamation at Nice, Nicomedia,
      Constantinople, Athens, and, during the remainder of his life, at Antioch.
      His school was assiduously frequented by the Grecian youth; his disciples,
      who sometimes exceeded the number of eighty, celebrated their incomparable
      master; and the jealousy of his rivals, who persecuted him from one city
      to another, confirmed the favorable opinion which Libanius ostentatiously
      displayed of his superior merit. The preceptors of Julian had extorted a
      rash but solemn assurance, that he would never attend the lectures of
      their adversary: the curiosity of the royal youth was checked and
      inflamed: he secretly procured the writings of this dangerous sophist, and
      gradually surpassed, in the perfect imitation of his style, the most
      laborious of his domestic pupils. <a href="#Blink24note-24" id="Blink24noteref-24" name="Blink24noteref-24">24</a> When Julian ascended
      the throne, he declared his impatience to embrace and reward the Syrian
      sophist, who had preserved, in a degenerate age, the Grecian purity of
      taste, of manners, and of religion. The emperor's prepossession was
      increased and justified by the discreet pride of his favorite. Instead of
      pressing, with the foremost of the crowd, into the palace of
      Constantinople, Libanius calmly expected his arrival at Antioch; withdrew
      from court on the first symptoms of coldness and indifference; required a
      formal invitation for each visit; and taught his sovereign an important
      lesson, that he might command the obedience of a subject, but that he must
      deserve the attachment of a friend. The sophists of every age, despising,
      or affecting to despise, the accidental distinctions of birth and fortune,
      <a href="#Blink24note-25" id="Blink24noteref-25" name="Blink24noteref-25">25</a>
      reserve their esteem for the superior qualities of the mind, with which
      they themselves are so plentifully endowed. Julian might disdain the
      acclamations of a venal court, who adored the Imperial purple; but he was
      deeply flattered by the praise, the admonition, the freedom, and the envy
      of an independent philosopher, who refused his favors, loved his person,
      celebrated his fame, and protected his memory. The voluminous writings of
      Libanius still exist; for the most part, they are the vain and idle
      compositions of an orator, who cultivated the science of words; the
      productions of a recluse student, whose mind, regardless of his
      contemporaries, was incessantly fixed on the Trojan war and the Athenian
      commonwealth. Yet the sophist of Antioch sometimes descended from this
      imaginary elevation; he entertained a various and elaborate
      correspondence; <a href="#Blink24note-26" id="Blink24noteref-26" name="Blink24noteref-26">26</a> he praised the virtues of his own times; he
      boldly arraigned the abuse of public and private life; and he eloquently
      pleaded the cause of Antioch against the just resentment of Julian and
      Theodosius. It is the common calamity of old age, <a href="#Blink24note-27" id="Blink24noteref-27" name="Blink24noteref-27">27</a> to lose whatever
      might have rendered it desirable; but Libanius experienced the peculiar
      misfortune of surviving the religion and the sciences, to which he had
      consecrated his genius. The friend of Julian was an indignant spectator of
      the triumph of Christianity; and his bigotry, which darkened the prospect
      of the visible world, did not inspire Libanius with any lively hopes of
      celestial glory and happiness. <a href="#Blink24note-28" id="Blink24noteref-28" name="Blink24noteref-28">28</a>

      The martial impatience of Julian urged him to take the field in the
      beginning of the spring; and he dismissed, with contempt and reproach, the
      senate of Antioch, who accompanied the emperor beyond the limits of their
      own territory, to which he was resolved never to return. After a laborious
      march of two days, <a href="#Blink24note-29" id="Blink24noteref-29" name="Blink24noteref-29">29</a> he halted on the third at Beraea, or Aleppo,
      where he had the mortification of finding a senate almost entirely
      Christian; who received with cold and formal demonstrations of respect the
      eloquent sermon of the apostle of paganism. The son of one of the most
      illustrious citizens of Beraea, who had embraced, either from interest or
      conscience, the religion of the emperor, was disinherited by his angry
      parent. The father and the son were invited to the Imperial table. Julian,
      placing himself between them, attempted, without success, to inculcate the
      lesson and example of toleration; supported, with affected calmness, the
      indiscreet zeal of the aged Christian, who seemed to forget the sentiments
      of nature, and the duty of a subject; and at length, turning towards the
      afflicted youth, "Since you have lost a father," said he, "for my sake, it
      is incumbent on me to supply his place." <a href="#Blink24note-30" id="Blink24noteref-30" name="Blink24noteref-30">30</a> The emperor was
      received in a manner much more agreeable to his wishes at Batnae, <a href="#Blink24note-3011" id="Blink24noteref-3011" name="Blink24noteref-3011">3011</a>
      a small town pleasantly seated in a grove of cypresses, about twenty miles
      from the city of Hierapolis. The solemn rites of sacrifice were decently
      prepared by the inhabitants of Batnae, who seemed attached to the worship
      of their tutelar deities, Apollo and Jupiter; but the serious piety of
      Julian was offended by the tumult of their applause; and he too clearly
      discerned, that the smoke which arose from their altars was the incense of
      flattery, rather than of devotion. The ancient and magnificent temple
      which had sanctified, for so many ages, the city of Hierapolis, <a href="#Blink24note-31" id="Blink24noteref-31" name="Blink24noteref-31">31</a>
      no longer subsisted; and the consecrated wealth, which afforded a liberal
      maintenance to more than three hundred priests, might hasten its downfall.
      Yet Julian enjoyed the satisfaction of embracing a philosopher and a
      friend, whose religious firmness had withstood the pressing and repeated
      solicitations of Constantius and Gallus, as often as those princes lodged
      at his house, in their passage through Hierapolis. In the hurry of
      military preparation, and the careless confidence of a familiar
      correspondence, the zeal of Julian appears to have been lively and
      uniform. He had now undertaken an important and difficult war; and the
      anxiety of the event rendered him still more attentive to observe and
      register the most trifling presages, from which, according to the rules of
      divination, any knowledge of futurity could be derived. <a href="#Blink24note-32" id="Blink24noteref-32" name="Blink24noteref-32">32</a>
      He informed Libanius of his progress as far as Hierapolis, by an elegant

      and his tender friendship for the sophist of Antioch.

      of the Roman troops, who immediately passed the great river on a bridge of
      boats, which was previously constructed. <a href="#Blink24note-35" id="Blink24noteref-35" name="Blink24noteref-35">35</a> If the inclinations
      of Julian had been similar to those of his predecessor, he might have
      wasted the active and important season of the year in the circus of
      Samosata or in the churches of Edessa. But as the warlike emperor, instead
      of Constantius, had chosen Alexander for his model, he advanced without
      delay to Carrhae, <a href="#Blink24note-36" id="Blink24noteref-36" name="Blink24noteref-36">36</a> a very ancient city of Mesopotamia, at the
      distance of fourscore miles from Hierapolis. The temple of the Moon
      attracted the devotion of Julian; but the halt of a few days was
      principally employed in completing the immense preparations of the Persian
      war. The secret of the expedition had hitherto remained in his own breast;
      but as Carrhae is the point of separation of the two great roads, he could
      no longer conceal whether it was his design to attack the dominions of
      Sapor on the side of the Tigris, or on that of the Euphrates. The emperor
      detached an army of thirty thousand men, under the command of his kinsman
      Procopius, and of Sebastian, who had been duke of Egypt. They were ordered
      to direct their march towards Nisibis, and to secure the frontier from the
      desultory incursions of the enemy, before they attempted the passage of
      the Tigris. Their subsequent operations were left to the discretion of the
      generals; but Julian expected, that after wasting with fire and sword the
      fertile districts of Media and Adiabene, they might arrive under the walls
      of Ctesiphon at the same time that he himself, advancing with equal steps
      along the banks of the Euphrates, should besiege the capital of the
      Persian monarchy. The success of this well-concerted plan depended, in a
      great measure, on the powerful and ready assistance of the king of
      Armenia, who, without exposing the safety of his own dominions, might
      detach an army of four thousand horse, and twenty thousand foot, to the
      assistance of the Romans. <a href="#Blink24note-37" id="Blink24noteref-37" name="Blink24noteref-37">37</a> But the feeble Arsaces Tiranus, <a href="#Blink24note-38" id="Blink24noteref-38" name="Blink24noteref-38">38</a>
      king of Armenia, had degenerated still more shamefully than his father
      Chosroes, from the manly virtues of the great Tiridates; and as the
      pusillanimous monarch was averse to any enterprise of danger and glory, he
      could disguise his timid indolence by the more decent excuses of religion
      and gratitude. He expressed a pious attachment to the memory of
      Constantius, from whose hands he had received in marriage Olympias, the
      daughter of the praefect Ablavius; and the alliance of a female, who had
      been educated as the destined wife of the emperor Constans, exalted the
      dignity of a Barbarian king. <a href="#Blink24note-39" id="Blink24noteref-39" name="Blink24noteref-39">39</a> Tiranus professed the
      Christian religion; he reigned over a nation of Christians; and he was
      restrained, by every principle of conscience and interest, from
      contributing to the victory, which would consummate the ruin of the
      church. The alienated mind of Tiranus was exasperated by the indiscretion
      of Julian, who treated the king of Armenia as his slave, and as the enemy
      of the gods. The haughty and threatening style of the Imperial mandates <a href="#Blink24note-40" id="Blink24noteref-40" name="Blink24noteref-40">40</a>
      awakened the secret indignation of a prince, who, in the humiliating state

      Arsacides, the lords of the East, and the rivals of the Roman power. <a href="#Blink24note-4011" id="Blink24noteref-4011" name="Blink24noteref-4011">4011</a>

      17th year of Constantius. ——Arsaces Tiranus, or Diran, had
      ceased to reign twenty-five years before, in 337. The intermediate changes
      in Armenia, and the character of this Arsaces, the son of Diran, are
      traced by M. St. Martin, at considerable length, in his supplement to Le
      Beau, ii. 208-242. As long as his Grecian queen Olympias maintained her
      influence, Arsaces was faithful to the Roman and Christian alliance. On
      the accession of Julian, the same influence made his fidelity to waver;
      but Olympias having been poisoned in the sacramental bread by the agency
      of Pharandcem, the former wife of Arsaces, another change took place in
      Armenian politics unfavorable to the Christian interest. The patriarch
      Narses retired from the impious court to a safe seclusion. Yet Pharandsem
      was equally hostile to the Persian influence, and Arsaces began to support
      with vigor the cause of Julian. He made an inroad into the Persian
      dominions with a body of Rans and Alans as auxiliaries; wasted Aderbidgan
      and Sapor, who had been defeated near Tauriz, was engaged in making head
      against his troops in Persarmenia, at the time of the death of Julian.
      Such is M. St. Martin's view, (ii. 276, et sqq.,) which rests on the
      Armenian historians, Faustos of Byzantium, and Mezrob the biographer of
      the Partriarch Narses. In the history of Armenia by Father Chamitch, and
      translated by Avdall, Tiran is still king of Armenia, at the time of
      Julian's death. F. Chamitch follows Moses of Chorene, The authority of

      The military dispositions of Julian were skilfully contrived to deceive
      the spies and to divert the attention of Sapor. The legions appeared to
      direct their march towards Nisibis and the Tigris. On a sudden they
      wheeled to the right; traversed the level and naked plain of Carrhae; and
      reached, on the third day, the banks of the Euphrates, where the strong
      town of Nicephorium, or Callinicum, had been founded by the Macedonian
      kings. From thence the emperor pursued his march, above ninety miles,
      along the winding stream of the Euphrates, till, at length, about one
      month after his departure from Antioch, he discovered the towers of
      Circesium, <a href="#Blink24note-4012" id="Blink24noteref-4012" name="Blink24noteref-4012">4012</a> the extreme limit of the Roman dominions.
      The army of Julian, the most numerous that any of the Caesars had ever led
      against Persia, consisted of sixty-five thousand effective and
      well-disciplined soldiers. The veteran bands of cavalry and infantry, of
      Romans and Barbarians, had been selected from the different provinces; and
      a just preeminence of loyalty and valor was claimed by the hardy Gauls,
      who guarded the throne and person of their beloved prince. A formidable
      body of Scythian auxiliaries had been transported from another climate,
      and almost from another world, to invade a distant country, of whose name
      and situation they were ignorant. The love of rapine and war allured to
      the Imperial standard several tribes of Saracens, or roving Arabs, whose
      service Julian had commanded, while he sternly refuse the payment of the
      accustomed subsidies. The broad channel of the Euphrates <a href="#Blink24note-41" id="Blink24noteref-41" name="Blink24noteref-41">41</a>
      was crowded by a fleet of eleven hundred ships, destined to attend the
      motions, and to satisfy the wants, of the Roman army. The military
      strength of the fleet was composed of fifty armed galleys; and these were
      accompanied by an equal number of flat-bottomed boats, which might
      occasionally be connected into the form of temporary bridges. The rest of
      the ships, partly constructed of timber, and partly covered with raw
      hides, were laden with an almost inexhaustible supply of arms and engines,
      of utensils and provisions. The vigilant humanity of Julian had embarked a
      very large magazine of vinegar and biscuit for the use of the soldiers,
      but he prohibited the indulgence of wine; and rigorously stopped a long
      string of superfluous camels that attempted to follow the rear of the
      army. The River Chaboras falls into the Euphrates at Circesium; <a href="#Blink24note-42" id="Blink24noteref-42" name="Blink24noteref-42">42</a>
      and as soon as the trumpet gave the signal of march, the Romans passed the
      little stream which separated two mighty and hostile empires. The custom
      of ancient discipline required a military oration; and Julian embraced
      every opportunity of displaying his eloquence. He animated the impatient
      and attentive legions by the example of the inflexible courage and
      glorious triumphs of their ancestors. He excited their resentment by a
      lively picture of the insolence of the Persians; and he exhorted them to
      imitate his firm resolution, either to extirpate that perfidious nation,
      or to devote his life in the cause of the republic. The eloquence of
      Julian was enforced by a donative of one hundred and thirty pieces of
      silver to every soldier; and the bridge of the Chaboras was instantly cut
      away, to convince the troops that they must place their hopes of safety in
      the success of their arms. Yet the prudence of the emperor induced him to
      secure a remote frontier, perpetually exposed to the inroads of the
      hostile Arabs. A detachment of four thousand men was left at Circesium,
      which completed, to the number of ten thousand, the regular garrison of
      that important fortress. <a href="#Blink24note-43" id="Blink24noteref-43" name="Blink24noteref-43">43</a>

      the country of an active and artful enemy, the order of march was disposed
      in three columns. <a href="#Blink24note-45" id="Blink24noteref-45" name="Blink24noteref-45">45</a> The strength of the infantry, and
      consequently of the whole army was placed in the centre, under the
      peculiar command of their master-general Victor. On the right, the brave
      Nevitta led a column of several legions along the banks of the Euphrates,
      and almost always in sight of the fleet. The left flank of the army was
      protected by the column of cavalry. Hormisdas and Arinthaeus were
      appointed generals of the horse; and the singular adventures of Hormisdas
      <a href="#Blink24note-46" id="Blink24noteref-46" name="Blink24noteref-46">46</a>
      are not undeserving of our notice. He was a Persian prince, of the royal
      race of the Sassanides, who, in the troubles of the minority of Sapor, had
      escaped from prison to the hospitable court of the great Constantine.
      Hormisdas at first excited the compassion, and at length acquired the
      esteem, of his new masters; his valor and fidelity raised him to the
      military honors of the Roman service; and though a Christian, he might
      indulge the secret satisfaction of convincing his ungrateful country, than
      at oppressed subject may prove the most dangerous enemy. Such was the
      disposition of the three principal columns. The front and flanks of the
      army were covered by Lucilianus with a flying detachment of fifteen
      hundred light-armed soldiers, whose active vigilance observed the most
      distant signs, and conveyed the earliest notice, of any hostile approach.
      Dagalaiphus, and Secundinus duke of Osrhoene, conducted the troops of the
      rear-guard; the baggage securely proceeded in the intervals of the
      columns; and the ranks, from a motive either of use or ostentation, were
      formed in such open order, that the whole line of march extended almost
      ten miles. The ordinary post of Julian was at the head of the centre
      column; but as he preferred the duties of a general to the state of a
      monarch, he rapidly moved, with a small escort of light cavalry, to the
      front, the rear, the flanks, wherever his presence could animate or
      protect the march of the Roman army. The country which they traversed from
      the Chaboras, to the cultivated lands of Assyria, may be considered as a
      part of the desert of Arabia, a dry and barren waste, which could never be
      improved by the most powerful arts of human industry. Julian marched over
      the same ground which had been trod above seven hundred years before by
      the footsteps of the younger Cyrus, and which is described by one of the
      companions of his expedition, the sage and heroic Xenophon. <a href="#Blink24note-47" id="Blink24noteref-47" name="Blink24noteref-47">47</a>
      "The country was a plain throughout, as even as the sea, and full of
      wormwood; and if any other kind of shrubs or reeds grew there, they had
      all an aromatic smell, but no trees could be seen. Bustards and ostriches,
      antelopes and wild asses, <a href="#Blink24note-48" id="Blink24noteref-48" name="Blink24noteref-48">48</a> appeared to be the only inhabitants of the
      desert; and the fatigues of the march were alleviated by the amusements of
      the chase." The loose sand of the desert was frequently raised by the wind
      into clouds of dust; and a great number of the soldiers of Julian, with
      their tents, were suddenly thrown to the ground by the violence of an
      unexpected hurricane.

      The sandy plains of Mesopotamia were abandoned to the antelopes and wild
      asses of the desert; but a variety of populous towns and villages were
      pleasantly situated on the banks of the Euphrates, and in the islands
      which are occasionally formed by that river. The city of Annah, or Anatho,
      <a href="#Blink24note-49" id="Blink24noteref-49" name="Blink24noteref-49">49</a>
      the actual residence of an Arabian emir, is composed of two long streets,
      which enclose, within a natural fortification, a small island in the
      midst, and two fruitful spots on either side, of the Euphrates. The
      warlike inhabitants of Anatho showed a disposition to stop the march of a
      Roman emperor; till they were diverted from such fatal presumption by the
      mild exhortations of Prince Hormisdas, and the approaching terrors of the
      fleet and army. They implored, and experienced, the clemency of Julian,
      who transplanted the people to an advantageous settlement, near Chalcis in
      Syria, and admitted Pusaeus, the governor, to an honorable rank in his
      service and friendship. But the impregnable fortress of Thilutha could
      scorn the menace of a siege; and the emperor was obliged to content
      himself with an insulting promise, that, when he had subdued the interior
      provinces of Persia, Thilutha would no longer refuse to grace the triumph
      of the emperor. The inhabitants of the open towns, unable to resist, and
      unwilling to yield, fled with precipitation; and their houses, filled with
      spoil and provisions, were occupied by the soldiers of Julian, who
      massacred, without remorse and without punishment, some defenceless women.

      incessantly hovered round the army; every straggler was intercepted; every
      detachment was attacked; and the valiant Hormisdas escaped with some
      difficulty from their hands. But the Barbarians were finally repulsed; the
      country became every day less favorable to the operations of cavalry; and
      when the Romans arrived at Macepracta, they perceived the ruins of the
      wall, which had been constructed by the ancient kings of Assyria, to
      secure their dominions from the incursions of the Medes. These
      preliminaries of the expedition of Julian appear to have employed about
      fifteen days; and we may compute near three hundred miles from the
      fortress of Circesium to the wall of Macepracta. <a href="#Blink24note-51" id="Blink24noteref-51" name="Blink24noteref-51">51</a>

      extended about four hundred miles from the ancient wall of Macepracta, to

      might have claimed the peculiar name of Mesopotamia; as the two rivers,
      which are never more distant than fifty, approach, between Bagdad and
      Babylon, within twenty-five miles, of each other. A multitude of
      artificial canals, dug without much labor in a soft and yielding soil
      connected the rivers, and intersected the plain of Assyria. The uses of
      these artificial canals were various and important. They served to
      discharge the superfluous waters from one river into the other, at the
      season of their respective inundations. Subdividing themselves into
      smaller and smaller branches, they refreshed the dry lands, and supplied
      the deficiency of rain. They facilitated the intercourse of peace and
      commerce; and, as the dams could be speedily broke down, they armed the
      despair of the Assyrians with the means of opposing a sudden deluge to the
      progress of an invading army. To the soil and climate of Assyria, nature
      had denied some of her choicest gifts, the vine, the olive, and the
      fig-tree; <a href="#Blink24note-5411" id="Blink24noteref-5411" name="Blink24noteref-5411">5411</a> but the food which supports the life of
      man, and particularly wheat and barley, were produced with inexhaustible
      fertility; and the husbandman, who committed his seed to the earth, was
      frequently rewarded with an increase of two, or even of three, hundred.
      The face of the country was interspersed with groves of innumerable
      palm-trees; <a href="#Blink24note-55" id="Blink24noteref-55" name="Blink24noteref-55">55</a> and the diligent natives celebrated, either
      in verse or prose, the three hundred and sixty uses to which the trunk,
      the branches, the leaves, the juice, and the fruit, were skilfully

      employed the industry of a numerous people, and afforded valuable

      conducted by the hands of strangers. Babylon had been converted into a
      royal park; but near the ruins of the ancient capital, new cities had
      successively arisen, and the populousness of the country was displayed in
      the multitude of towns and villages, which were built of bricks dried in
      the sun, and strongly cemented with bitumen; the natural and peculiar
      production of the Babylonian soil. While the successors of Cyrus reigned
      over Asia, the province of Syria alone maintained, during a third part of
      the year, the luxurious plenty of the table and household of the Great
      King. Four considerable villages were assigned for the subsistence of his
      Indian dogs; eight hundred stallions, and sixteen thousand mares, were
      constantly kept, at the expense of the country, for the royal stables; and
      as the daily tribute, which was paid to the satrap, amounted to one
      English bushe of silver, we may compute the annual revenue of Assyria at
      more than twelve hundred thousand pounds sterling. <a href="#Blink24note-56" id="Blink24noteref-56" name="Blink24noteref-56">56</a>

      The fields of Assyria were devoted by Julian to the calamities of war; and
      the philosopher retaliated on a guiltless people the acts of rapine and
      cruelty which had been committed by their haughty master in the Roman
      provinces. The trembling Assyrians summoned the rivers to their
      assistance; and completed, with their own hands, the ruin of their
      country. The roads were rendered impracticable; a flood of waters was
      poured into the camp; and, during several days, the troops of Julian were
      obliged to contend with the most discouraging hardships. But every
      obstacle was surmounted by the perseverance of the legionaries, who were
      inured to toil as well as to danger, and who felt themselves animated by
      the spirit of their leader. The damage was gradually repaired; the waters
      were restored to their proper channels; whole groves of palm-trees were
      cut down, and placed along the broken parts of the road; and the army
      passed over the broad and deeper canals, on bridges of floating rafts,
      which were supported by the help of bladders. Two cities of Assyria
      presumed to resist the arms of a Roman emperor: and they both paid the
      severe penalty of their rashness. At the distance of fifty miles from the
      royal residence of Ctesiphon, Perisabor, <a href="#Blink24note-5711" id="Blink24noteref-5711" name="Blink24noteref-5711">5711</a> or Anbar, held
      the second rank in the province; a city, large, populous, and well
      fortified, surrounded with a double wall, almost encompassed by a branch
      of the Euphrates, and defended by the valor of a numerous garrison. The
      exhortations of Hormisdas were repulsed with contempt; and the ears of the
      Persian prince were wounded by a just reproach, that, unmindful of his
      royal birth, he conducted an army of strangers against his king and
      country. The Assyrians maintained their loyalty by a skilful, as well as
      vigorous, defence; till the lucky stroke of a battering-ram, having opened
      a large breach, by shattering one of the angles of the wall, they hastily
      retired into the fortifications of the interior citadel. The soldiers of
      Julian rushed impetuously into the town, and after the full gratification
      of every military appetite, Perisabor was reduced to ashes; and the
      engines which assaulted the citadel were planted on the ruins of the
      smoking houses. The contest was continued by an incessant and mutual
      discharge of missile weapons; and the superiority which the Romans might
      derive from the mechanical powers of their balistae and catapultae was
      counterbalanced by the advantage of the ground on the side of the
      besieged. But as soon as an Helepolis had been constructed, which could
      engage on equal terms with the loftiest ramparts, the tremendous aspect of
      a moving turret, that would leave no hope of resistance or mercy,
      terrified the defenders of the citadel into an humble submission; and the
      place was surrendered only two days after Julian first appeared under the
      walls of Perisabor. Two thousand five hundred persons, of both sexes, the
      feeble remnant of a flourishing people, were permitted to retire; the
      plentiful magazines of corn, of arms, and of splendid furniture, were
      partly distributed among the troops, and partly reserved for the public
      service; the useless stores were destroyed by fire or thrown into the
      stream of the Euphrates; and the fate of Amida was revenged by the total
      ruin of Perisabor.

      The city or rather fortress, of Maogamalcha, which was defended by sixteen
      large towers, a deep ditch, and two strong and solid walls of brick and
      bitumen, appears to have been constructed at the distance of eleven miles,
      as the safeguard of the capital of Persia. The emperor, apprehensive of
      leaving such an important fortress in his rear, immediately formed the
      siege of Maogamalcha; and the Roman army was distributed, for that
      purpose, into three divisions. Victor, at the head of the cavalry, and of
      a detachment of heavy-armed foot, was ordered to clear the country, as far
      as the banks of the Tigris, and the suburbs of Ctesiphon. The conduct of
      the attack was assumed by Julian himself, who seemed to place his whole
      dependence in the military engines which he erected against the walls;
      while he secretly contrived a more efficacious method of introducing his
      troops into the heart of the city Under the direction of Nevitta and
      Dagalaiphus, the trenches were opened at a considerable distance, and
      gradually prolonged as far as the edge of the ditch. The ditch was
      speedily filled with earth; and, by the incessant labor of the troops, a
      mine was carried under the foundations of the walls, and sustained, at
      sufficient intervals, by props of timber. Three chosen cohorts, advancing
      in a single file, silently explored the dark and dangerous passage; till
      their intrepid leader whispered back the intelligence, that he was ready
      to issue from his confinement into the streets of the hostile city. Julian
      checked their ardor, that he might insure their success; and immediately
      diverted the attention of the garrison, by the tumult and clamor of a
      general assault. The Persians, who, from their walls, contemptuously
      beheld the progress of an impotent attack, celebrated with songs of
      triumph the glory of Sapor; and ventured to assure the emperor, that he
      might ascend the starry mansion of Ormusd, before he could hope to take
      the impregnable city of Maogamalcha. The city was already taken. History
      has recorded the name of a private soldier the first who ascended from the
      mine into a deserted tower. The passage was widened by his companions, who
      pressed forwards with impatient valor. Fifteen hundred enemies were
      already in the midst of the city. The astonished garrison abandoned the
      walls, and their only hope of safety; the gates were instantly burst open;
      and the revenge of the soldier, unless it were suspended by lust or
      avarice, was satiated by an undistinguishing massacre. The governor, who
      had yielded on a promise of mercy, was burnt alive, a few days afterwards,
      on a charge of having uttered some disrespectful words against the honor
      of Prince Hormisdas. The fortifications were razed to the ground; and not
      a vestige was left, that the city of Maogamalcha had ever existed. The
      neighborhood of the capital of Persia was adorned with three stately
      palaces, laboriously enriched with every production that could gratify the
      luxury and pride of an Eastern monarch. The pleasant situation of the
      gardens along the banks of the Tigris, was improved, according to the
      Persian taste, by the symmetry of flowers, fountains, and shady walks: and
      spacious parks were enclosed for the reception of the bears, lions, and
      wild boars, which were maintained at a considerable expense for the
      pleasure of the royal chase. The park walls were broken down, the savage
      game was abandoned to the darts of the soldiers, and the palaces of Sapor
      were reduced to ashes, by the command of the Roman emperor. Julian, on
      this occasion, showed himself ignorant, or careless, of the laws of
      civility, which the prudence and refinement of polished ages have
      established between hostile princes. Yet these wanton ravages need not
      excite in our breasts any vehement emotions of pity or resentment. A
      simple, naked statue, finished by the hand of a Grecian artist, is of more
      genuine value than all these rude and costly monuments of Barbaric labor;
      and, if we are more deeply affected by the ruin of a palace than by the
      conflagration of a cottage, our humanity must have formed a very erroneous
      estimate of the miseries of human life. <a href="#Blink24note-57" id="Blink24noteref-57" name="Blink24noteref-57">57</a>

      To his friends and soldiers the philosophic hero appeared in a more
      amiable light; and his virtues were never more conspicuously displayed,
      than in the last and most active period of his life. He practised, without
      effort, and almost without merit, the habitual qualities of temperance and
      sobriety. According to the dictates of that artificial wisdom, which
      assumes an absolute dominion over the mind and body, he sternly refused
      himself the indulgence of the most natural appetites. <a href="#Blink24note-59" id="Blink24noteref-59" name="Blink24noteref-59">59</a>
      In the warm climate of Assyria, which solicited a luxurious people to the
      gratification of every sensual desire, <a href="#Blink24note-60" id="Blink24noteref-60" name="Blink24noteref-60">60</a> a youthful conqueror
      preserved his chastity pure and inviolate; nor was Julian ever tempted,
      even by a motive of curiosity, to visit his female captives of exquisite
      beauty, <a href="#Blink24note-61" id="Blink24noteref-61" name="Blink24noteref-61">61</a> who, instead of resisting his power, would
      have disputed with each other the honor of his embraces. With the same
      firmness that he resisted the allurements of love, he sustained the
      hardships of war. When the Romans marched through the flat and flooded
      country, their sovereign, on foot, at the head of his legions, shared
      their fatigues and animated their diligence. In every useful labor, the
      hand of Julian was prompt and strenuous; and the Imperial purple was wet
      and dirty as the coarse garment of the meanest soldier. The two sieges
      allowed him some remarkable opportunities of signalizing his personal
      valor, which, in the improved state of the military art, can seldom be
      exerted by a prudent general. The emperor stood before the citadel before
      the citadel of Perisabor, insensible of his extreme danger, and encouraged
      his troops to burst open the gates of iron, till he was almost overwhelmed
      under a cloud of missile weapons and huge stones, that were directed
      against his person. As he examined the exterior fortifications of
      Maogamalcha, two Persians, devoting themselves for their country, suddenly
      rushed upon him with drawn cimeters: the emperor dexterously received
      their blows on his uplifted shield; and, with a steady and well-aimed
      thrust, laid one of his adversaries dead at his feet. The esteem of a
      prince who possesses the virtues which he approves, is the noblest
      recompense of a deserving subject; and the authority which Julian derived
      from his personal merit, enabled him to revive and enforce the rigor of
      ancient discipline. He punished with death or ignominy the misbehavior of
      three troops of horse, who, in a skirmish with the Surenas, had lost their
      honor and one of their standards: and he distinguished with obsidional <a href="#Blink24note-62" id="Blink24noteref-62" name="Blink24noteref-62">62</a>
      crowns the valor of the foremost soldiers, who had ascended into the city
      of Maogamalcha.
    </p>
<p>
      After the siege of Perisabor, the firmness of the emperor was exercised by
      the insolent avarice of the army, who loudly complained, that their
      services were rewarded by a trifling donative of one hundred pieces of
      silver. His just indignation was expressed in the grave and manly language
      of a Roman. "Riches are the object of your desires; those riches are in
      the hands of the Persians; and the spoils of this fruitful country are
      proposed as the prize of your valor and discipline. Believe me," added
      Julian, "the Roman republic, which formerly possessed such immense
      treasures, is now reduced to want and wretchedness once our princes have
      been persuaded, by weak and interested ministers, to purchase with gold
      the tranquillity of the Barbarians. The revenue is exhausted; the cities
      are ruined; the provinces are dispeopled. For myself, the only inheritance
      that I have received from my royal ancestors is a soul incapable of fear;
      and as long as I am convinced that every real advantage is seated in the
      mind, I shall not blush to acknowledge an honorable poverty, which, in the
      days of ancient virtue, was considered as the glory of Fabricius. That
      glory, and that virtue, may be your own, if you will listen to the voice
      of Heaven and of your leader. But if you will rashly persist, if you are
      determined to renew the shameful and mischievous examples of old
      seditions, proceed. As it becomes an emperor who has filled the first rank
      among men, I am prepared to die, standing; and to despise a precarious
      life, which, every hour, may depend on an accidental fever. If I have been
      found unworthy of the command, there are now among you, (I speak it with
      pride and pleasure,) there are many chiefs whose merit and experience are
      equal to the conduct of the most important war. Such has been the temper
      of my reign, that I can retire, without regret, and without apprehension,
      to the obscurity of a private station" <a href="#Blink24note-63" id="Blink24noteref-63" name="Blink24noteref-63">63</a> The modest resolution
      of Julian was answered by the unanimous applause and cheerful obedience of
      the Romans, who declared their confidence of victory, while they fought
      under the banners of their heroic prince. Their courage was kindled by his
      frequent and familiar asseverations, (for such wishes were the oaths of
      Julian,) "So may I reduce the Persians under the yoke!" "Thus may I
      restore the strength and splendor of the republic!" The love of fame was
      the ardent passion of his soul: but it was not before he trampled on the
      ruins of Maogamalcha, that he allowed himself to say, "We have now
      provided some materials for the sophist of Antioch." <a href="#Blink24note-64" id="Blink24noteref-64" name="Blink24noteref-64">64</a>

      The successful valor of Julian had triumphed over all the obstacles that
      opposed his march to the gates of Ctesiphon. But the reduction, or even

      military conduct of the emperor be clearly apprehended, without a
      knowledge of the country which was the theatre of his bold and skilful

      were forever extinguished; and the only remaining quarter of that Greek
      colony had resumed, with the Assyrian language and manners, the primitive
      appellation of Coche. Coche was situate on the western side of the Tigris;
      but it was naturally considered as a suburb of Ctesiphon, with which we
      may suppose it to have been connected by a permanent bridge of boats.

      strongly fortified by the waters of the river, by lofty walls, and by
      impracticable morasses. Near the ruins of Seleucia, the camp of Julian was
      fixed, and secured, by a ditch and rampart, against the sallies of the
      numerous and enterprising garrison of Coche. In this fruitful and pleasant
      country, the Romans were plentifully supplied with water and forage: and
      several forts, which might have embarrassed the motions of the army,
      submitted, after some resistance, to the efforts of their valor. The fleet
      passed from the Euphrates into an artificial derivation of that river,
      which pours a copious and navigable stream into the Tigris, at a small
      distance below the great city. If they had followed this royal canal,
      which bore the name of Nahar-Malcha, <a href="#Blink24note-66" id="Blink24noteref-66" name="Blink24noteref-66">66</a> the intermediate
      situation of Coche would have separated the fleet and army of Julian; and
      the rash attempt of steering against the current of the Tigris, and
      forcing their way through the midst of a hostile capital, must have been
      attended with the total destruction of the Roman navy. The prudence of the
      emperor foresaw the danger, and provided the remedy. As he had minutely
      studied the operations of Trajan in the same country, he soon recollected
      that his warlike predecessor had dug a new and navigable canal, which,
      leaving Coche on the right hand, conveyed the waters of the Nahar-Malcha
      into the river Tigris, at some distance above the cities. From the
      information of the peasants, Julian ascertained the vestiges of this
      ancient work, which were almost obliterated by design or accident. By the
      indefatigable labor of the soldiers, a broad and deep channel was speedily
      prepared for the reception of the Euphrates. A strong dike was constructed
      to interrupt the ordinary current of the Nahar-Malcha: a flood of waters
      rushed impetuously into their new bed; and the Roman fleet, steering their
      triumphant course into the Tigris, derided the vain and ineffectual
      barriers which the Persians of Ctesiphon had erected to oppose their
      passage.

      As it became necessary to transport the Roman army over the Tigris,
      another labor presented itself, of less toil, but of more danger, than the
      preceding expedition. The stream was broad and rapid; the ascent steep and
      difficult; and the intrenchments which had been formed on the ridge of the
      opposite bank, were lined with a numerous army of heavy cuirrasiers,
      dexterous archers, and huge elephants; who (according to the extravagant
      hyperbole of Libanius) could trample with the same ease a field of corn,
      or a legion of Romans. <a href="#Blink24note-67" id="Blink24noteref-67" name="Blink24noteref-67">67</a> In the presence of such an enemy, the
      construction of a bridge was impracticable; and the intrepid prince, who
      instantly seized the only possible expedient, concealed his design, till
      the moment of execution, from the knowledge of the Barbarians, of his own
      troops, and even of his generals themselves. Under the specious pretence
      of examining the state of the magazines, fourscore vessels <a href="#Blink24note-6711" id="Blink24noteref-6711" name="Blink24noteref-6711">6711</a>
      were gradually unladen; and a select detachment, apparently destined for
      some secret expedition, was ordered to stand to their arms on the first
      signal. Julian disguised the silent anxiety of his own mind with smiles of
      confidence and joy; and amused the hostile nations with the spectacle of
      military games, which he insultingly celebrated under the walls of Coche.
      The day was consecrated to pleasure; but, as soon as the hour of supper
      was passed, the emperor summoned the generals to his tent, and acquainted
      them that he had fixed that night for the passage of the Tigris. They
      stood in silent and respectful astonishment; but, when the venerable
      Sallust assumed the privilege of his age and experience, the rest of the
      chiefs supported with freedom the weight of his prudent remonstrances. <a href="#Blink24note-68" id="Blink24noteref-68" name="Blink24noteref-68">68</a>
      Julian contented himself with observing, that conquest and safety depended
      on the attempt; that instead of diminishing, the number of their enemies
      would be increased, by successive reenforcements; and that a longer delay
      would neither contract the breadth of the stream, nor level the height of
      the bank. The signal was instantly given, and obeyed; the most impatient
      of the legionaries leaped into five vessels that lay nearest to the bank;
      and as they plied their oars with intrepid diligence, they were lost,
      after a few moments, in the darkness of the night. A flame arose on the
      opposite side; and Julian, who too clearly understood that his foremost
      vessels, in attempting to land, had been fired by the enemy, dexterously
      converted their extreme danger into a presage of victory. "Our
      fellow-soldiers," he eagerly exclaimed, "are already masters of the bank;
      see—they make the appointed signal; let us hasten to emulate and
      assist their courage." The united and rapid motion of a great fleet broke
      the violence of the current, and they reached the eastern shore of the
      Tigris with sufficient speed to extinguish the flames, and rescue their
      adventurous companions. The difficulties of a steep and lofty ascent were
      increased by the weight of armor, and the darkness of the night. A shower
      of stones, darts, and fire, was incessantly discharged on the heads of the
      assailants; who, after an arduous struggle, climbed the bank and stood
      victorious upon the rampart. As soon as they possessed a more equal field,
      Julian, who, with his light infantry, had led the attack, <a href="#Blink24note-69" id="Blink24noteref-69" name="Blink24noteref-69">69</a>
      darted through the ranks a skilful and experienced eye: his bravest
      soldiers, according to the precepts of Homer, <a href="#Blink24note-70" id="Blink24noteref-70" name="Blink24noteref-70">70</a> were distributed in
      the front and rear: and all the trumpets of the Imperial army sounded to
      battle. The Romans, after sending up a military shout, advanced in
      measured steps to the animating notes of martial music; launched their
      formidable javelins; and rushed forwards with drawn swords, to deprive the
      Barbarians, by a closer onset, of the advantage of their missile weapons.
      The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours; till the gradual retreat
      of the Persians was changed into a disorderly flight, of which the
      shameful example was given by the principal leader, and the Surenas
      himself. They were pursued to the gates of Ctesiphon; and the conquerors
      might have entered the dismayed city, <a href="#Blink24note-71" id="Blink24noteref-71" name="Blink24noteref-71">71</a> if their general,
      Victor, who was dangerously wounded with an arrow, had not conjured them
      to desist from a rash attempt, which must be fatal, if it were not
      successful. On their side, the Romans acknowledged the loss of only
      seventy-five men; while they affirmed, that the Barbarians had left on the
      field of battle two thousand five hundred, or even six thousand, of their
      bravest soldiers. The spoil was such as might be expected from the riches
      and luxury of an Oriental camp; large quantities of silver and gold,
      splendid arms and trappings, and beds and tables of massy silver. <a href="#Blink24note-7111" id="Blink24noteref-7111" name="Blink24noteref-7111">7111</a>
      The victorious emperor distributed, as the rewards of valor, some
      honorable gifts, civic, and mural, and naval crowns; which he, and perhaps
      he alone, esteemed more precious than the wealth of Asia. A solemn
      sacrifice was offered to the god of war, but the appearances of the
      victims threatened the most inauspicious events; and Julian soon
      discovered, by less ambiguous signs, that he had now reached the term of
      his prosperity. <a href="#Blink24note-72" id="Blink24noteref-72" name="Blink24noteref-72">72</a>

      While the Persians beheld from the walls of Ctesiphon the desolation of
      the adjacent country, Julian cast many an anxious look towards the North,
      in full expectation, that as he himself had victoriously penetrated to the
      capital of Sapor, the march and junction of his lieutenants, Sebastian and
      Procopius, would be executed with the same courage and diligence. His
      expectations were disappointed by the treachery of the Armenian king, who
      permitted, and most probably directed, the desertion of his auxiliary
      troops from the camp of the Romans; <a href="#Blink24note-74" id="Blink24noteref-74" name="Blink24noteref-74">74</a> and by the
      dissensions of the two generals, who were incapable of forming or
      executing any plan for the public service. When the emperor had
      relinquished the hope of this important reenforcement, he condescended to
      hold a council of war, and approved, after a full debate, the sentiment of
      those generals, who dissuaded the siege of Ctesiphon, as a fruitless and
      pernicious undertaking. It is not easy for us to conceive, by what arts of
      fortification a city thrice besieged and taken by the predecessors of
      Julian could be rendered impregnable against an army of sixty thousand
      Romans, commanded by a brave and experienced general, and abundantly
      supplied with ships, provisions, battering engines, and military stores.
      But we may rest assured, from the love of glory, and contempt of danger,
      which formed the character of Julian, that he was not discouraged by any
      trivial or imaginary obstacles. <a href="#Blink24note-75" id="Blink24noteref-75" name="Blink24noteref-75">75</a> At the very time when
      he declined the siege of Ctesiphon, he rejected, with obstinacy and
      disdain, the most flattering offers of a negotiation of peace. Sapor, who
      had been so long accustomed to the tardy ostentation of Constantius, was
      surprised by the intrepid diligence of his successor. As far as the
      confines of India and Scythia, the satraps of the distant provinces were
      ordered to assemble their troops, and to march, without delay, to the
      assistance of their monarch. But their preparations were dilatory, their
      motions slow; and before Sapor could lead an army into the field, he
      received the melancholy intelligence of the devastation of Assyria, the
      ruin of his palaces, and the slaughter of his bravest troops, who defended
      the passage of the Tigris. The pride of royalty was humbled in the dust;
      he took his repasts on the ground; and the disorder of his hair expressed
      the grief and anxiety of his mind. Perhaps he would not have refused to
      purchase, with one half of his kingdom, the safety of the remainder; and
      he would have gladly subscribed himself, in a treaty of peace, the
      faithful and dependent ally of the Roman conqueror. Under the pretence of
      private business, a minister of rank and confidence was secretly
      despatched to embrace the knees of Hormisdas, and to request, in the
      language of a suppliant, that he might be introduced into the presence of
      the emperor. The Sassanian prince, whether he listened to the voice of
      pride or humanity, whether he consulted the sentiments of his birth, or
      the duties of his situation, was equally inclined to promote a salutary
      measure, which would terminate the calamities of Persia, and secure the
      triumph of Rome. He was astonished by the inflexible firmness of a hero,
      who remembered, most unfortunately for himself and for his country, that
      Alexander had uniformly rejected the propositions of Darius. But as Julian
      was sensible, that the hope of a safe and honorable peace might cool the
      ardor of his troops, he earnestly requested that Hormisdas would privately
      dismiss the minister of Sapor, and conceal this dangerous temptation from
      the knowledge of the camp. <a href="#Blink24note-76" id="Blink24noteref-76" name="Blink24noteref-76">76</a>

      The honor, as well as interest, of Julian, forbade him to consume his time
      under the impregnable walls of Ctesiphon and as often as he defied the
      Barbarians, who defended the city, to meet him on the open plain, they
      prudently replied, that if he desired to exercise his valor, he might seek
      the army of the Great King. He felt the insult, and he accepted the
      advice. Instead of confining his servile march to the banks of the
      Euphrates and Tigris, he resolved to imitate the adventurous spirit of
      Alexander, and boldly to advance into the inland provinces, till he forced
      his rival to contend with him, perhaps in the plains of Arbela, for the
      empire of Asia. The magnanimity of Julian was applauded and betrayed, by
      the arts of a noble Persian, who, in the cause of his country, had
      generously submitted to act a part full of danger, of falsehood, and of
      shame. <a href="#Blink24note-77" id="Blink24noteref-77" name="Blink24noteref-77">77</a> With a train of faithful followers, he
      deserted to the Imperial camp; exposed, in a specious tale, the injuries
      which he had sustained; exaggerated the cruelty of Sapor, the discontent
      of the people, and the weakness of the monarchy; and confidently offered
      himself as the hostage and guide of the Roman march. The most rational
      grounds of suspicion were urged, without effect, by the wisdom and
      experience of Hormisdas; and the credulous Julian, receiving the traitor
      into his bosom, was persuaded to issue a hasty order, which, in the
      opinion of mankind, appeared to arraign his prudence, and to endanger his
      safety. He destroyed, in a single hour, the whole navy, which had been
      transported above five hundred miles, at so great an expense of toil, of
      treasure, and of blood. Twelve, or, at the most, twenty-two small vessels
      were saved, to accompany, on carriages, the march of the army, and to form
      occasional bridges for the passage of the rivers. A supply of twenty days'
      provisions was reserved for the use of the soldiers; and the rest of the
      magazines, with a fleet of eleven hundred vessels, which rode at anchor in
      the Tigris, were abandoned to the flames, by the absolute command of the
      emperor. The Christian bishops, Gregory and Augustin, insult the madness
      of the Apostate, who executed, with his own hands, the sentence of divine
      justice. Their authority, of less weight, perhaps, in a military question,
      is confirmed by the cool judgment of an experienced soldier, who was
      himself spectator of the conflagration, and who could not disapprove the
      reluctant murmurs of the troops. <a href="#Blink24note-78" id="Blink24noteref-78" name="Blink24noteref-78">78</a> Yet there are not
      wanting some specious, and perhaps solid, reasons, which might justify the
      resolution of Julian. The navigation of the Euphrates never ascended above
      Babylon, nor that of the Tigris above Opis. <a href="#Blink24note-79" id="Blink24noteref-79" name="Blink24noteref-79">79</a> The distance of the
      last-mentioned city from the Roman camp was not very considerable: and
      Julian must soon have renounced the vain and impracticable attempt of
      forcing upwards a great fleet against the stream of a rapid river, <a href="#Blink24note-80" id="Blink24noteref-80" name="Blink24noteref-80">80</a>
      which in several places was embarrassed by natural or artificial
      cataracts. <a href="#Blink24note-81" id="Blink24noteref-81" name="Blink24noteref-81">81</a> The power of sails and oars was insufficient;
      it became necessary to tow the ships against the current of the river; the
      strength of twenty thousand soldiers was exhausted in this tedious and
      servile labor, and if the Romans continued to march along the banks of the
      Tigris, they could only expect to return home without achieving any
      enterprise worthy of the genius or fortune of their leader. If, on the
      contrary, it was advisable to advance into the inland country, the
      destruction of the fleet and magazines was the only measure which could
      save that valuable prize from the hands of the numerous and active troops
      which might suddenly be poured from the gates of Ctesiphon. Had the arms
      of Julian been victorious, we should now admire the conduct, as well as
      the courage, of a hero, who, by depriving his soldiers of the hopes of a
      retreat, left them only the alternative of death or conquest. <a href="#Blink24note-82" id="Blink24noteref-82" name="Blink24noteref-82">82</a>

      The cumbersome train of artillery and wagons, which retards the operations
      of a modern army, were in a great measure unknown in the camps of the
      Romans. <a href="#Blink24note-83" id="Blink24noteref-83" name="Blink24noteref-83">83</a> Yet, in every age, the subsistence of sixty
      thousand men must have been one of the most important cares of a prudent
      general; and that subsistence could only be drawn from his own or from the
      enemy's country. Had it been possible for Julian to maintain a bridge of
      communication on the Tigris, and to preserve the conquered places of
      Assyria, a desolated province could not afford any large or regular
      supplies, in a season of the year when the lands were covered by the
      inundation of the Euphrates, <a href="#Blink24note-84" id="Blink24noteref-84" name="Blink24noteref-84">84</a> and the unwholesome
      air was darkened with swarms of innumerable insects. <a href="#Blink24note-85" id="Blink24noteref-85" name="Blink24noteref-85">85</a>
      The appearance of the hostile country was far more inviting. The extensive
      region that lies between the River Tigris and the mountains of Media, was
      filled with villages and towns; and the fertile soil, for the most part,
      was in a very improved state of cultivation. Julian might expect, that a
      conqueror, who possessed the two forcible instruments of persuasion, steel
      and gold, would easily procure a plentiful subsistence from the fears or
      avarice of the natives. But, on the approach of the Romans, the rich and
      smiling prospect was instantly blasted. Wherever they moved, the
      inhabitants deserted the open villages, and took shelter in the fortified
      towns; the cattle was driven away; the grass and ripe corn were consumed
      with fire; and, as soon as the flames had subsided which interrupted the
      march of Julian, he beheld the melancholy face of a smoking and naked
      desert. This desperate but effectual method of defence can only be
      executed by the enthusiasm of a people who prefer their independence to
      their property; or by the rigor of an arbitrary government, which consults
      the public safety without submitting to their inclinations the liberty of
      choice. On the present occasion the zeal and obedience of the Persians
      seconded the commands of Sapor; and the emperor was soon reduced to the
      scanty stock of provisions, which continually wasted in his hands. Before
      they were entirely consumed, he might still have reached the wealthy and
      unwarlike cities of Ecbatana or Susa, by the effort of a rapid and
      well-directed march; <a href="#Blink24note-86" id="Blink24noteref-86" name="Blink24noteref-86">86</a> but he was deprived of this last resource by
      his ignorance of the roads, and by the perfidy of his guides. The Romans
      wandered several days in the country to the eastward of Bagdad; the
      Persian deserter, who had artfully led them into the spare, escaped from
      their resentment; and his followers, as soon as they were put to the
      torture, confessed the secret of the conspiracy. The visionary conquests
      of Hyrcania and India, which had so long amused, now tormented, the mind
      of Julian. Conscious that his own imprudence was the cause of the public
      distress, he anxiously balanced the hopes of safety or success, without
      obtaining a satisfactory answer, either from gods or men. At length, as
      the only practicable measure, he embraced the resolution of directing his
      steps towards the banks of the Tigris, with the design of saving the army
      by a hasty march to the confines of Corduene; a fertile and friendly
      province, which acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome. The desponding
      troops obeyed the signal of the retreat, only seventy days after they had
      passed the Chaboras, with the sanguine expectation of subverting the
      throne of Persia. <a href="#Blink24note-87" id="Blink24noteref-87" name="Blink24noteref-87">87</a>

    </p>
<p>
      As long as the Romans seemed to advance into the country, their march was
      observed and insulted from a distance, by several bodies of Persian
      cavalry; who, showing themselves sometimes in loose, and sometimes in
      close order, faintly skirmished with the advanced guards. These
      detachments were, however, supported by a much greater force; and the
      heads of the columns were no sooner pointed towards the Tigris than a
      cloud of dust arose on the plain. The Romans, who now aspired only to the
      permission of a safe and speedy retreat, endeavored to persuade
      themselves, that this formidable appearance was occasioned by a troop of
      wild asses, or perhaps by the approach of some friendly Arabs. They
      halted, pitched their tents, fortified their camp, passed the whole night
      in continual alarms; and discovered at the dawn of day, that they were
      surrounded by an army of Persians. This army, which might be considered
      only as the van of the Barbarians, was soon followed by the main body of
      cuirassiers, archers, and elephants, commanded by Meranes, a general of
      rank and reputation. He was accompanied by two of the king's sons, and
      many of the principal satraps; and fame and expectation exaggerated the
      strength of the remaining powers, which slowly advanced under the conduct
      of Sapor himself. As the Romans continued their march, their long array,
      which was forced to bend or divide, according to the varieties of the
      ground, afforded frequent and favorable opportunities to their vigilant
      enemies. The Persians repeatedly charged with fury; they were repeatedly
      repulsed with firmness; and the action at Maronga, which almost deserved
      the name of a battle, was marked by a considerable loss of satraps and
      elephants, perhaps of equal value in the eyes of their monarch. These
      splendid advantages were not obtained without an adequate slaughter on the
      side of the Romans: several officers of distinction were either killed or
      wounded; and the emperor himself, who, on all occasions of danger,
      inspired and guided the valor of his troops, was obliged to expose his
      person, and exert his abilities. The weight of offensive and defensive
      arms, which still constituted the strength and safety of the Romans,
      disabled them from making any long or effectual pursuit; and as the
      horsemen of the East were trained to dart their javelins, and shoot their
      arrows, at full speed, and in every possible direction, <a href="#Blink24note-88" id="Blink24noteref-88" name="Blink24noteref-88">88</a>
      the cavalry of Persia was never more formidable than in the moment of a
      rapid and disorderly flight. But the most certain and irreparable loss of
      the Romans was that of time. The hardy veterans, accustomed to the cold
      climate of Gaul and Germany, fainted under the sultry heat of an Assyrian
      summer; their vigor was exhausted by the incessant repetition of march and
      combat; and the progress of the army was suspended by the precautions of a
      slow and dangerous retreat, in the presence of an active enemy. Every day,
      every hour, as the supply diminished, the value and price of subsistence
      increased in the Roman camp. <a href="#Blink24note-89" id="Blink24noteref-89" name="Blink24noteref-89">89</a> Julian, who always
      contented himself with such food as a hungry soldier would have disdained,
      distributed, for the use of the troops, the provisions of the Imperial
      household, and whatever could be spared, from the sumpter-horses, of the
      tribunes and generals. But this feeble relief served only to aggravate the
      sense of the public distress; and the Romans began to entertain the most
      gloomy apprehensions that, before they could reach the frontiers of the
      empire, they should all perish, either by famine, or by the sword of the
      Barbarians. <a href="#Blink24note-90" id="Blink24noteref-90" name="Blink24noteref-90">90</a>

      While Julian struggled with the almost insuperable difficulties of his
      situation, the silent hours of the night were still devoted to study and
      contemplation. Whenever he closed his eyes in short and interrupted
      slumbers, his mind was agitated with painful anxiety; nor can it be
      thought surprising, that the Genius of the empire should once more appear
      before him, covering with a funeral veil his head, and his horn of
      abundance, and slowly retiring from the Imperial tent. The monarch started
      from his couch, and stepping forth to refresh his wearied spirits with the
      coolness of the midnight air, he beheld a fiery meteor, which shot athwart
      the sky, and suddenly vanished. Julian was convinced that he had seen the
      menacing countenance of the god of war; <a href="#Blink24note-91" id="Blink24noteref-91" name="Blink24noteref-91">91</a> the council which he
      summoned, of Tuscan Haruspices, <a href="#Blink24note-92" id="Blink24noteref-92" name="Blink24noteref-92">92</a> unanimously
      pronounced that he should abstain from action; but on this occasion,
      necessity and reason were more prevalent than superstition; and the
      trumpets sounded at the break of day. The army marched through a hilly
      country; and the hills had been secretly occupied by the Persians. Julian
      led the van with the skill and attention of a consummate general; he was
      alarmed by the intelligence that his rear was suddenly attacked. The heat
      of the weather had tempted him to lay aside his cuirass; but he snatched a
      shield from one of his attendants, and hastened, with a sufficient
      reenforcement, to the relief of the rear-guard. A similar danger recalled
      the intrepid prince to the defence of the front; and, as he galloped
      through the columns, the centre of the left was attacked, and almost
      overpowered by the furious charge of the Persian cavalry and elephants.
      This huge body was soon defeated, by the well-timed evolution of the light
      infantry, who aimed their weapons, with dexterity and effect, against the
      backs of the horsemen, and the legs of the elephants. The Barbarians fled;
      and Julian, who was foremost in every danger, animated the pursuit with
      his voice and gestures. His trembling guards, scattered and oppressed by
      the disorderly throng of friends and enemies, reminded their fearless
      sovereign that he was without armor; and conjured him to decline the fall
      of the impending ruin. As they exclaimed, <a href="#Blink24note-93" id="Blink24noteref-93" name="Blink24noteref-93">93</a> a cloud of darts and
      arrows was discharged from the flying squadrons; and a javelin, after
      razing the skin of his arm, transpierced the ribs, and fixed in the
      inferior part of the liver. Julian attempted to draw the deadly weapon
      from his side; but his fingers were cut by the sharpness of the steel, and
      he fell senseless from his horse. His guards flew to his relief; and the
      wounded emperor was gently raised from the ground, and conveyed out of the
      tumult of the battle into an adjacent tent. The report of the melancholy
      event passed from rank to rank; but the grief of the Romans inspired them
      with invincible valor, and the desire of revenge. The bloody and obstinate
      conflict was maintained by the two armies, till they were separated by the
      total darkness of the night. The Persians derived some honor from the
      advantage which they obtained against the left wing, where Anatolius,
      master of the offices, was slain, and the praefect Sallust very narrowly
      escaped. But the event of the day was adverse to the Barbarians. They
      abandoned the field; their two generals, Meranes and Nohordates, <a href="#Blink24note-94" id="Blink24noteref-94" name="Blink24noteref-94">94</a>
      fifty nobles or satraps, and a multitude of their bravest soldiers; and

      improved into a decisive and useful victory.

      The first words that Julian uttered, after his recovery from the fainting
      fit into which he had been thrown by loss of blood, were expressive of his
      martial spirit. He called for his horse and arms, and was impatient to
      rush into the battle. His remaining strength was exhausted by the painful
      effort; and the surgeons, who examined his wound, discovered the symptoms
      of approaching death. He employed the awful moments with the firm temper
      of a hero and a sage; the philosophers who had accompanied him in this
      fatal expedition, compared the tent of Julian with the prison of Socrates;
      and the spectators, whom duty, or friendship, or curiosity, had assembled
      round his couch, listened with respectful grief to the funeral oration of
      their dying emperor. <a href="#Blink24note-95" id="Blink24noteref-95" name="Blink24noteref-95">95</a> "Friends and fellow-soldiers, the seasonable
      period of my departure is now arrived, and I discharge, with the
      cheerfulness of a ready debtor, the demands of nature. I have learned from
      philosophy, how much the soul is more excellent than the body; and that
      the separation of the nobler substance should be the subject of joy,
      rather than of affliction. I have learned from religion, that an early
      death has often been the reward of piety; <a href="#Blink24note-96" id="Blink24noteref-96" name="Blink24noteref-96">96</a> and I accept, as a
      favor of the gods, the mortal stroke that secures me from the danger of
      disgracing a character, which has hitherto been supported by virtue and
      fortitude. I die without remorse, as I have lived without guilt. I am
      pleased to reflect on the innocence of my private life; and I can affirm
      with confidence, that the supreme authority, that emanation of the Divine
      Power, has been preserved in my hands pure and immaculate. Detesting the
      corrupt and destructive maxims of despotism, I have considered the
      happiness of the people as the end of government. Submitting my actions to
      the laws of prudence, of justice, and of moderation, I have trusted the
      event to the care of Providence. Peace was the object of my counsels, as
      long as peace was consistent with the public welfare; but when the
      imperious voice of my country summoned me to arms, I exposed my person to
      the dangers of war, with the clear foreknowledge (which I had acquired
      from the art of divination) that I was destined to fall by the sword. I
      now offer my tribute of gratitude to the Eternal Being, who has not
      suffered me to perish by the cruelty of a tyrant, by the secret dagger of
      conspiracy, or by the slow tortures of lingering disease. He has given me,
      in the midst of an honorable career, a splendid and glorious departure
      from this world; and I hold it equally absurd, equally base, to solicit,
      or to decline, the stroke of fate. This much I have attempted to say; but
      my strength fails me, and I feel the approach of death. I shall cautiously
      refrain from any word that may tend to influence your suffrages in the
      election of an emperor. My choice might be imprudent or injudicious; and
      if it should not be ratified by the consent of the army, it might be fatal
      to the person whom I should recommend. I shall only, as a good citizen,
      express my hopes, that the Romans may be blessed with the government of a
      virtuous sovereign." After this discourse, which Julian pronounced in a

      the remains of his private fortune; and making some inquiry why Anatolius
      was not present, he understood, from the answer of Sallust, that Anatolius
      was killed; and bewailed, with amiable inconsistency, the loss of his
      friend. At the same time he reproved the immoderate grief of the
      spectators; and conjured them not to disgrace, by unmanly tears, the fate
      of a prince, who in a few moments would be united with heaven, and with
      the stars. <a href="#Blink24note-98" id="Blink24noteref-98" name="Blink24noteref-98">98</a> The spectators were silent; and Julian
      entered into a metaphysical argument with the philosophers Priscus and
      Maximus, on the nature of the soul. The efforts which he made, of mind as
      well as body, most probably hastened his death. His wound began to bleed
      with fresh violence; his respiration was embarrassed by the swelling of
      the veins; he called for a draught of cold water, and, as soon as he had
      drank it, expired without pain, about the hour of midnight. Such was the
      end of that extraordinary man, in the thirty-second year of his age, after
      a reign of one year and about eight months, from the death of Constantius.
      In his last moments he displayed, perhaps with some ostentation, the love
      of virtue and of fame, which had been the ruling passions of his life. <a href="#Blink24note-99" id="Blink24noteref-99" name="Blink24noteref-99">99</a>

    </p>
<p>
      The triumph of Christianity, and the calamities of the empire, may, in
      some measure, be ascribed to Julian himself, who had neglected to secure
      the future execution of his designs, by the timely and judicious
      nomination of an associate and successor. But the royal race of
      Constantius Chlorus was reduced to his own person; and if he entertained
      any serious thoughts of investing with the purple the most worthy among
      the Romans, he was diverted from his resolution by the difficulty of the
      choice, the jealousy of power, the fear of ingratitude, and the natural
      presumption of health, of youth, and of prosperity. His unexpected death
      left the empire without a master, and without an heir, in a state of
      perplexity and danger, which, in the space of fourscore years, had never
      been experienced, since the election of Diocletian. In a government which
      had almost forgotten the distinction of pure and noble blood, the
      superiority of birth was of little moment; the claims of official rank
      were accidental and precarious; and the candidates, who might aspire to
      ascend the vacant throne could be supported only by the consciousness of
      personal merit, or by the hopes of popular favor. But the situation of a
      famished army, encompassed on all sides by a host of Barbarians, shortened
      the moments of grief and deliberation. In this scene of terror and
      distress, the body of the deceased prince, according to his own
      directions, was decently embalmed; and, at the dawn of day, the generals
      convened a military senate, at which the commanders of the legions, and
      the officers both of cavalry and infantry, were invited to assist. Three
      or four hours of the night had not passed away without some secret cabals;
      and when the election of an emperor was proposed, the spirit of faction
      began to agitate the assembly. Victor and Arinthaeus collected the remains
      of the court of Constantius; the friends of Julian attached themselves to
      the Gallic chiefs, Dagalaiphus and Nevitta; and the most fatal
      consequences might be apprehended from the discord of two factions, so
      opposite in their character and interest, in their maxims of government,
      and perhaps in their religious principles. The superior virtues of Sallust
      could alone reconcile their divisions, and unite their suffrages; and the
      venerable praefect would immediately have been declared the successor of
      Julian, if he himself, with sincere and modest firmness, had not alleged
      his age and infirmities, so unequal to the weight of the diadem. The
      generals, who were surprised and perplexed by his refusal, showed some
      disposition to adopt the salutary advice of an inferior officer, <a href="#Blink24note-100" id="Blink24noteref-100" name="Blink24noteref-100">100</a>
      that they should act as they would have acted in the absence of the
      emperor; that they should exert their abilities to extricate the army from
      the present distress; and, if they were fortunate enough to reach the
      confines of Mesopotamia, they should proceed with united and deliberate
      counsels in the election of a lawful sovereign. While they debated, a few
      voices saluted Jovian, who was no more than first <a href="#Blink24note-101" id="Blink24noteref-101" name="Blink24noteref-101">101</a> of the domestics,
      with the names of Emperor and Augustus. The tumultuary acclamation <a href="#Blink24note-10111" id="Blink24noteref-10111" name="Blink24noteref-10111">10111</a> was instantly repeated by the guards
      who surrounded the tent, and passed, in a few minutes, to the extremities
      of the line. The new prince, astonished with his own fortune was hastily
      invested with the Imperial ornaments, and received an oath of fidelity
      from the generals, whose favor and protection he so lately solicited. The
      strongest recommendation of Jovian was the merit of his father, Count
      Varronian, who enjoyed, in honorable retirement, the fruit of his long
      services. In the obscure freedom of a private station, the son indulged
      his taste for wine and women; yet he supported, with credit, the character
      of a Christian <a href="#Blink24note-102" id="Blink24noteref-102" name="Blink24noteref-102">102</a> and a soldier. Without being conspicuous
      for any of the ambitious qualifications which excite the admiration and
      envy of mankind, the comely person of Jovian, his cheerful temper, and
      familiar wit, had gained the affection of his fellow-soldiers; and the
      generals of both parties acquiesced in a popular election, which had not
      been conducted by the arts of their enemies. The pride of this unexpected
      elevation was moderated by the just apprehension, that the same day might
      terminate the life and reign of the new emperor. The pressing voice of
      necessity was obeyed without delay; and the first orders issued by Jovian,
      a few hours after his predecessor had expired, were to prosecute a march,
      which could alone extricate the Romans from their actual distress. <a href="#Blink24note-103" id="Blink24noteref-103" name="Blink24noteref-103">103</a>

      The esteem of an enemy is most sincerely expressed by his fears; and the
      degree of fear may be accurately measured by the joy with which he
      celebrates his deliverance. The welcome news of the death of Julian, which
      a deserter revealed to the camp of Sapor, inspired the desponding monarch
      with a sudden confidence of victory. He immediately detached the royal
      cavalry, perhaps the ten thousand Immortals, <a href="#Blink24note-104" id="Blink24noteref-104" name="Blink24noteref-104">104</a> to second and
      support the pursuit; and discharged the whole weight of his united forces
      on the rear-guard of the Romans. The rear-guard was thrown into disorder;
      the renowned legions, which derived their titles from Diocletian, and his
      warlike colleague, were broke and trampled down by the elephants; and
      three tribunes lost their lives in attempting to stop the flight of their
      soldiers. The battle was at length restored by the persevering valor of
      the Romans; the Persians were repulsed with a great slaughter of men and
      elephants; and the army, after marching and fighting a long summer's day,
      arrived, in the evening, at Samara, on the banks of the Tigris, about one
      hundred miles above Ctesiphon. <a href="#Blink24note-105" id="Blink24noteref-105" name="Blink24noteref-105">105</a> On the ensuing
      day, the Barbarians, instead of harassing the march, attacked the camp, of
      Jovian; which had been seated in a deep and sequestered valley. From the
      hills, the archers of Persia insulted and annoyed the wearied legionaries;
      and a body of cavalry, which had penetrated with desperate courage through
      the Praetorian gate, was cut in pieces, after a doubtful conflict, near
      the Imperial tent. In the succeeding night, the camp of Carche was
      protected by the lofty dikes of the river; and the Roman army, though
      incessantly exposed to the vexatious pursuit of the Saracens, pitched
      their tents near the city of Dura, <a href="#Blink24note-106" id="Blink24noteref-106" name="Blink24noteref-106">106</a> four days after
      the death of Julian. The Tigris was still on their left; their hopes and
      provisions were almost consumed; and the impatient soldiers, who had
      fondly persuaded themselves that the frontiers of the empire were not far
      distant, requested their new sovereign, that they might be permitted to
      hazard the passage of the river. With the assistance of his wisest
      officers, Jovian endeavored to check their rashness; by representing, that
      if they possessed sufficient skill and vigor to stem the torrent of a deep
      and rapid stream, they would only deliver themselves naked and defenceless
      to the Barbarians, who had occupied the opposite banks, Yielding at length
      to their clamorous importunities, he consented, with reluctance, that five
      hundred Gauls and Germans, accustomed from their infancy to the waters of
      the Rhine and Danube, should attempt the bold adventure, which might serve
      either as an encouragement, or as a warning, for the rest of the army. In
      the silence of the night, they swam the Tigris, surprised an unguarded
      post of the enemy, and displayed at the dawn of day the signal of their
      resolution and fortune. The success of this trial disposed the emperor to
      listen to the promises of his architects, who propose to construct a
      floating bridge of the inflated skins of sheep, oxen, and goats, covered
      with a floor of earth and fascines. <a href="#Blink24note-107" id="Blink24noteref-107" name="Blink24noteref-107">107</a> Two important days
      were spent in the ineffectual labor; and the Romans, who already endured

      In this hopeless condition, the fainting spirits of the Romans were
      revived by the sound of peace. The transient presumption of Sapor had
      vanished: he observed, with serious concern, that, in the repetition of
      doubtful combats, he had lost his most faithful and intrepid nobles, his
      bravest troops, and the greatest part of his train of elephants: and the
      experienced monarch feared to provoke the resistance of despair, the
      vicissitudes of fortune, and the unexhausted powers of the Roman empire;
      which might soon advance to elieve, or to revenge, the successor of
      Julian. The Surenas himself, accompanied by another satrap, appeared in
      the camp of Jovian; <a href="#Blink24note-109" id="Blink24noteref-109" name="Blink24noteref-109">109</a> and declared, that the clemency of his
      sovereign was not averse to signify the conditions on which he would
      consent to spare and to dismiss the Caesar with the relics of his captive
      army. <a href="#Blink24note-10911" id="Blink24noteref-10911" name="Blink24noteref-10911">10911</a> The hopes of safety subdued the
      firmness of the Romans; the emperor was compelled, by the advice of his

      the conclusion of the agreement; started difficulties, required
      explanations, suggested expedients, receded from his concessions,
      increased his demands, and wasted four days in the arts of negotiation,
      till he had consumed the stock of provisions which yet remained in the
      camp of the Romans. Had Jovian been capable of executing a bold and
      prudent measure, he would have continued his march, with unremitting
      diligence; the progress of the treaty would have suspended the attacks of
      the Barbarians; and, before the expiration of the fourth day, he might
      have safely reached the fruitful province of Corduene, at the distance

      fate with patient resignation; and accepted the humiliating conditions of
      peace, which it was no longer in his power to refuse. The five provinces
      beyond the Tigris, which had been ceded by the grandfather of Sapor, were
      restored to the Persian monarchy. He acquired, by a single article, the
      impregnable city of Nisibis; which had sustained, in three successive
      sieges, the effort of his arms. Singara, and the castle of the Moors, one
      of the strongest places of Mesopotamia, were likewise dismembered from the
      empire. It was considered as an indulgence, that the inhabitants of those
      fortresses were permitted to retire with their effects; but the conqueror
      rigorously insisted, that the Romans should forever abandon the king and

      have been plundered, made captives, and slain. It is for this that I have
      bared my arm, and girded my loins. If you consent to pay the price of the
      blood which has been shed, to deliver up the booty which has been
      plundered, and to restore the city of Nisibis, which is in Irak, and
      belongs to our empire, though now in your possession, I will sheathe the
      sword of war; but should you refuse these terms, the hoofs of my horse,
      which are hard as steel, shall efface the name of the Romans from the
      earth; and my glorious cimeter, that destroys like fire, shall exterminate
      the people of your empire." These authorities do not mention the death of
      Julian. Malcolm's Persia, i. 87.—M.]

      The sophist of Antioch, who saw with indignation the sceptre of his hero
      in the feeble hand of a Christian successor, professes to admire the
      moderation of Sapor, in contenting himself with so small a portion of the
      Roman empire. If he had stretched as far as the Euphrates the claims of
      his ambition, he might have been secure, says Libanius, of not meeting
      with a refusal. If he had fixed, as the boundary of Persia, the Orontes,
      the Cydnus, the Sangarius, or even the Thracian Bosphorus, flatterers
      would not have been wanting in the court of Jovian to convince the timid
      monarch, that his remaining provinces would still afford the most ample
      gratifications of power and luxury. <a href="#Blink24note-112" id="Blink24noteref-112" name="Blink24noteref-112">112</a> Without adopting
      in its full force this malicious insinuation, we must acknowledge, that
      the conclusion of so ignominious a treaty was facilitated by the private
      ambition of Jovian. The obscure domestic, exalted to the throne by
      fortune, rather than by merit, was impatient to escape from the hands of
      the Persians, that he might prevent the designs of Procopius, who
      commanded the army of Mesopotamia, and establish his doubtful reign over
      the legions and provinces which were still ignorant of the hasty and
      tumultuous choice of the camp beyond the Tigris. <a href="#Blink24note-113" id="Blink24noteref-113" name="Blink24noteref-113">113</a> In the

      or guides, or provisions, were abandoned, above twelve hundred miles from
      their native country, to the resentment of a victorious monarch. The
      difference of their conduct and success depended much more on their
      character than on their situation. Instead of tamely resigning themselves
      to the secret deliberations and private views of a single person, the
      united councils of the Greeks were inspired by the generous enthusiasm of
      a popular assembly; where the mind of each citizen is filled with the love
      of glory, the pride of freedom, and the contempt of death. Conscious of
      their superiority over the Barbarians in arms and discipline, they
      disdained to yield, they refused to capitulate: every obstacle was
      surmounted by their patience, courage, and military skill; and the

      the Persian monarchy. <a href="#Blink24note-115" id="Blink24noteref-115" name="Blink24noteref-115">115</a>

      As the price of his disgraceful concessions, the emperor might perhaps
      have stipulated, that the camp of the hungry Romans should be plentifully
      supplied; <a href="#Blink24note-116" id="Blink24noteref-116" name="Blink24noteref-116">116</a> and that they should be permitted to pass
      the Tigris on the bridge which was constructed by the hands of the
      Persians. But, if Jovian presumed to solicit those equitable terms, they
      were sternly refused by the haughty tyrant of the East, whose clemency had
      pardoned the invaders of his country. The Saracens sometimes intercepted
      the stragglers of the march; but the generals and troops of Sapor
      respected the cessation of arms; and Jovian was suffered to explore the
      most convenient place for the passage of the river. The small vessels,
      which had been saved from the conflagration of the fleet, performed the
      most essential service. They first conveyed the emperor and his favorites;
      and afterwards transported, in many successive voyages, a great part of
      the army. But, as every man was anxious for his personal safety, and
      apprehensive of being left on the hostile shore, the soldiers, who were
      too impatient to wait the slow returns of the boats, boldly ventured
      themselves on light hurdles, or inflated skins; and, drawing after them
      their horses, attempted, with various success, to swim across the river.
      Many of these daring adventurers were swallowed by the waves; many others,
      who were carried along by the violence of the stream, fell an easy prey to
      the avarice or cruelty of the wild Arabs: and the loss which the army
      sustained in the passage of the Tigris, was not inferior to the carnage of
      a day of battle. As soon as the Romans were landed on the western bank,
      they were delivered from the hostile pursuit of the Barbarians; but, in a
      laborious march of two hundred miles over the plains of Mesopotamia, they
      endured the last extremities of thirst and hunger. They were obliged to
      traverse the sandy desert, which, in the extent of seventy miles, did not
      afford a single blade of sweet grass, nor a single spring of fresh water;
      and the rest of the inhospitable waste was untrod by the footsteps either
      of friends or enemies. Whenever a small measure of flour could be
      discovered in the camp, twenty pounds weight were greedily purchased with
      ten pieces of gold: <a href="#Blink24note-117" id="Blink24noteref-117" name="Blink24noteref-117">117</a> the beasts of burden were slaughtered and
      devoured; and the desert was strewed with the arms and baggage of the
      Roman soldiers, whose tattered garments and meagre countenances displayed
      their past sufferings and actual misery. A small convoy of provisions
      advanced to meet the army as far as the castle of Ur; and the supply was
      the more grateful, since it declared the fidelity of Sebastian and
      Procopius. At Thilsaphata, <a href="#Blink24note-118" id="Blink24noteref-118" name="Blink24noteref-118">118</a> the emperor most
      graciously received the generals of Mesopotamia; and the remains of a once
      flourishing army at length reposed themselves under the walls of Nisibis.
      The messengers of Jovian had already proclaimed, in the language of
      flattery, his election, his treaty, and his return; and the new prince had
      taken the most effectual measures to secure the allegiance of the armies
      and provinces of Europe, by placing the military command in the hands of
      those officers, who, from motives of interest, or inclination, would
      firmly support the cause of their benefactor. <a href="#Blink24note-119" id="Blink24noteref-119" name="Blink24noteref-119">119</a>

      The friends of Julian had confidently announced the success of his
      expedition. They entertained a fond persuasion that the temples of the
      gods would be enriched with the spoils of the East; that Persia would be
      reduced to the humble state of a tributary province, governed by the laws
      and magistrates of Rome; that the Barbarians would adopt the dress, and
      manners, and language of their conquerors; and that the youth of Ecbatana
      and Susa would study the art of rhetoric under Grecian masters. <a href="#Blink24note-120" id="Blink24noteref-120" name="Blink24noteref-120">120</a>
      The progress of the arms of Julian interrupted his communication with the
      empire; and, from the moment that he passed the Tigris, his affectionate
      subjects were ignorant of the fate and fortunes of their prince. Their
      contemplation of fancied triumphs was disturbed by the melancholy rumor of
      his death; and they persisted to doubt, after they could no longer deny,
      the truth of that fatal event. <a href="#Blink24note-121" id="Blink24noteref-121" name="Blink24noteref-121">121</a> The messengers of
      Jovian promulgated the specious tale of a prudent and necessary peace; the
      voice of fame, louder and more sincere, revealed the disgrace of the
      emperor, and the conditions of the ignominious treaty. The minds of the
      people were filled with astonishment and grief, with indignation and
      terror, when they were informed, that the unworthy successor of Julian
      relinquished the five provinces which had been acquired by the victory of
      Galerius; and that he shamefully surrendered to the Barbarians the
      important city of Nisibis, the firmest bulwark of the provinces of the

      public safety, was freely agitated in popular conversation; and some hopes
      were entertained that the emperor would redeem his pusillanimous behavior
      by a splendid act of patriotic perfidy. The inflexible spirit of the Roman
      senate had always disclaimed the unequal conditions which were extorted
      from the distress of their captive armies; and, if it were necessary to
      satisfy the national honor, by delivering the guilty general into the
      hands of the Barbarians, the greatest part of the subjects of Jovian would
      have cheerfully acquiesced in the precedent of ancient times. <a href="#Blink24note-123" id="Blink24noteref-123" name="Blink24noteref-123">123</a>

      But the emperor, whatever might be the limits of his constitutional
      authority, was the absolute master of the laws and arms of the state; and
      the same motives which had forced him to subscribe, now pressed him to
      execute, the treaty of peace. He was impatient to secure an empire at the
      expense of a few provinces; and the respectable names of religion and
      honor concealed the personal fears and ambition of Jovian. Notwithstanding
      the dutiful solicitations of the inhabitants, decency, as well as
      prudence, forbade the emperor to lodge in the palace of Nisibis; but the
      next morning after his arrival. Bineses, the ambassador of Persia, entered
      the place, displayed from the citadel the standard of the Great King, and
      proclaimed, in his name, the cruel alternative of exile or servitude. The
      principal citizens of Nisibis, who, till that fatal moment, had confided
      in the protection of their sovereign, threw themselves at his feet. They
      conjured him not to abandon, or, at least, not to deliver, a faithful
      colony to the rage of a Barbarian tyrant, exasperated by the three
      successive defeats which he had experienced under the walls of Nisibis.
      They still possessed arms and courage to repel the invaders of their
      country: they requested only the permission of using them in their own
      defence; and, as soon as they had asserted their independence, they should
      implore the favor of being again admitted into the ranks of his subjects.
      Their arguments, their eloquence, their tears, were ineffectual. Jovian
      alleged, with some confusion, the sanctity of oaths; and, as the
      reluctance with which he accepted the present of a crown of gold,
      convinced the citizens of their hopeless condition, the advocate Sylvanus
      was provoked to exclaim, "O emperor! may you thus be crowned by all the
      cities of your dominions!" Jovian, who in a few weeks had assumed the
      habits of a prince, <a href="#Blink24note-124" id="Blink24noteref-124" name="Blink24noteref-124">124</a> was displeased with freedom, and offended
      with truth: and as he reasonably supposed, that the discontent of the
      people might incline them to submit to the Persian government, he
      published an edict, under pain of death, that they should leave the city
      within the term of three days. Ammianus has delineated in lively colors
      the scene of universal despair, which he seems to have viewed with an eye
      of compassion. <a href="#Blink24note-125" id="Blink24noteref-125" name="Blink24noteref-125">125</a> The martial youth deserted, with indignant
      grief, the walls which they had so gloriously defended: the disconsolate
      mourner dropped a last tear over the tomb of a son or husband, which must
      soon be profaned by the rude hand of a Barbarian master; and the aged
      citizen kissed the threshold, and clung to the doors, of the house where
      he had passed the cheerful and careless hours of infancy. The highways
      were crowded with a trembling multitude: the distinctions of rank, and
      sex, and age, were lost in the general calamity. Every one strove to bear
      away some fragment from the wreck of his fortunes; and as they could not
      command the immediate service of an adequate number of horses or wagons,
      they were obliged to leave behind them the greatest part of their valuable
      effects. The savage insensibility of Jovian appears to have aggravated the
      hardships of these unhappy fugitives. They were seated, however, in a
      new-built quarter of Amida; and that rising city, with the reenforcement
      of a very considerable colony, soon recovered its former splendor, and
      became the capital of Mesopotamia. <a href="#Blink24note-126" id="Blink24noteref-126" name="Blink24noteref-126">126</a> Similar orders
      were despatched by the emperor for the evacuation of Singara and the
      castle of the Moors; and for the restitution of the five provinces beyond
      the Tigris. Sapor enjoyed the glory and the fruits of his victory; and
      this ignominious peace has justly been considered as a memorable aera in
      the decline and fall of the Roman empire. The predecessors of Jovian had
      sometimes relinquished the dominion of distant and unprofitable provinces;
      but, since the foundation of the city, the genius of Rome, the god
      Terminus, who guarded the boundaries of the republic, had never retired
      before the sword of a victorious enemy. <a href="#Blink24note-127" id="Blink24noteref-127" name="Blink24noteref-127">127</a>

      After Jovian had performed those engagements which the voice of his people
      might have tempted him to violate, he hastened away from the scene of his
      disgrace, and proceeded with his whole court to enjoy the luxury of
      Antioch. <a href="#Blink24note-128" id="Blink24noteref-128" name="Blink24noteref-128">128</a> Without consulting the dictates of
      religious zeal, he was prompted, by humanity and gratitude, to bestow the
      last honors on the remains of his deceased sovereign: <a href="#Blink24note-129" id="Blink24noteref-129" name="Blink24noteref-129">129</a>
      and Procopius, who sincerely bewailed the loss of his kinsman, was removed
      from the command of the army, under the decent pretence of conducting the
      funeral. The corpse of Julian was transported from Nisibis to Tarsus, in a
      slow march of fifteen days; and, as it passed through the cities of the
      East, was saluted by the hostile factions, with mournful lamentations and
      clamorous insults. The Pagans already placed their beloved hero in the
      rank of those gods whose worship he had restored; while the invectives of
      the Christians pursued the soul of the Apostate to hell, and his body to
      the grave. <a href="#Blink24note-130" id="Blink24noteref-130" name="Blink24noteref-130">130</a> One party lamented the approaching ruin of
      their altars; the other celebrated the marvellous deliverance of their
      church. The Christians applauded, in lofty and ambiguous strains, the
      stroke of divine vengeance, which had been so long suspended over the
      guilty head of Julian. They acknowledge, that the death of the tyrant, at
      the instant he expired beyond the Tigris, was revealed to the saints of
      Egypt, Syria, and Cappadocia; <a href="#Blink24note-131" id="Blink24noteref-131" name="Blink24noteref-131">131</a> and instead of
      suffering him to fall by the Persian darts, their indiscretion ascribed
      the heroic deed to the obscure hand of some mortal or immortal champion of
      the faith. <a href="#Blink24note-132" id="Blink24noteref-132" name="Blink24noteref-132">132</a> Such imprudent declarations were eagerly
      adopted by the malice, or credulity, of their adversaries; <a href="#Blink24note-133" id="Blink24noteref-133" name="Blink24noteref-133">133</a>
      who darkly insinuated, or confidently asserted, that the governors of the
      church had instigated and directed the fanaticism of a domestic assassin.

      Above sixteen years after the death of Julian, the charge was solemnly and
      vehemently urged, in a public oration, addressed by Libanius to the
      emperor Theodosius. His suspicions are unsupported by fact or argument;
      and we can only esteem the generous zeal of the sophist of Antioch for the
      cold and neglected ashes of his friend. <a href="#Blink24note-135" id="Blink24noteref-135" name="Blink24noteref-135">135</a>

      It was an ancient custom in the funerals, as well as in the triumphs, of
      the Romans, that the voice of praise should be corrected by that of satire
      and ridicule; and that, in the midst of the splendid pageants, which
      displayed the glory of the living or of the dead, their imperfections
      should not be concealed from the eyes of the world. <a href="#Blink24note-136" id="Blink24noteref-136" name="Blink24noteref-136">136</a>
      This custom was practised in the funeral of Julian. The comedians, who
      resented his contempt and aversion for the theatre, exhibited, with the
      applause of a Christian audience, the lively and exaggerated
      representation of the faults and follies of the deceased emperor. His
      various character and singular manners afforded an ample scope for
      pleasantry and ridicule. <a href="#Blink24note-137" id="Blink24noteref-137" name="Blink24noteref-137">137</a> In the exercise of his uncommon talents, he
      often descended below the majesty of his rank. Alexander was transformed
      into Diogenes; the philosopher was degraded into a priest. The purity of
      his virtue was sullied by excessive vanity; his superstition disturbed the
      peace, and endangered the safety, of a mighty empire; and his irregular
      sallies were the less entitled to indulgence, as they appeared to be the
      laborious efforts of art, or even of affectation. The remains of Julian
      were interred at Tarsus in Cilicia; but his stately tomb, which arose in
      that city, on the banks of the cold and limpid Cydnus, <a href="#Blink24note-138" id="Blink24noteref-138" name="Blink24noteref-138">138</a>
      was displeasing to the faithful friends, who loved and revered the memory
      of that extraordinary man. The philosopher expressed a very reasonable
      wish, that the disciple of Plato might have reposed amidst the groves of
      the academy; <a href="#Blink24note-139" id="Blink24noteref-139" name="Blink24noteref-139">139</a> while the soldier exclaimed, in bolder
      accents, that the ashes of Julian should have been mingled with those of
      Caesar, in the field of Mars, and among the ancient monuments of Roman
      virtue. <a href="#Blink24note-140" id="Blink24noteref-140" name="Blink24noteref-140">140</a> The history of princes does not very
